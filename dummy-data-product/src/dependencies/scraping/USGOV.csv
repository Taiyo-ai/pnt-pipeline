These reports are available at: http://www.sab.hq.af.mil/Archives/index.htm. PRDA Scope: This announcement seeks to acquire the technologies necessary to prototype demonstrable results for the following:1. JBI Fuselets;2. JBI Fuselet Scripting Language and Rule Sets; 3. JBI Fuselet Server and Library; 4. Tools for JBI Fuselet Execution Monitoring and Management as well as to answer the following kinds of research questions: 1. How can we use agent technology to develop JBI fuselets, and DASADA technology to model, simulate, and control their combinatorial structure and behavior? 2. How can we use DASADA technology to model and build JBIP components like the Fuselet Server and Fuselet Library, and examine/control their interaction with fuselets, information objects, clients, and other JBIP components? 3. How can we use DASADA gauging technology to determine the ""fusability"" of information objects, and what kinds of fuselets would be appropriate for them? 4. How can we build off of this to provide the scripting, diagnostic, repair, configuration, monitoring, inspection, and management tools needed by the JFC Information Management Staff? JBI Characteristics: At the foundation of the JBI is a JBI Platform (JBIP) of protocols, processes, and common core functions that permit participating applications and organizations to share and exchange critical mission information in a timely manner. It provides uniform mechanisms for publishing new and updated objects into the JBI, and promptly alerts any JBI clients that are subscribing to such objects. These properties enable dynamic information flows among client programs of the JBI, serving to integrate the clients to conduct a single mission. The operation of the JBI depends on the proper flow of information via dynamic publish/subscribe linkages. If some aspect of this automated information flow is not working properly, the Joint Force Commander (JFC) Information Management Staff will need to diagnose and fix the problem quickly. Perhaps a JBI fuselet, further described below (and the focus of this PRDA), has failed and is no longer subscribing to and processing its inputs. To monitor and repair the JBI, the Information Management Staff will need to be familiar with the information structure represented in the JBI, and will need tools to inspect objects, clients, and fuselets that participate in the structure. JBI Fuselets: A fuselet is small program that subscribes to JBI information and publishes one or more new objects as a result of receiving the information being subscribed to. Characteristics of fuselets for the JBI include the following: - Fuselets are written using a scripting language by Information Management Staff. They can be created from scratch using scripting tools and rule sets, or can be extracted by the JBI Fuselet Server (described below) from a library of fuselets, used as is or configured/modified to meet mission requirements. Fuslets can be used to encode a commander's standing orders (e.g., ""policy""). - Fuselets operate on a set of rules (e.g., boolean and probabilistic IF-THEN rules) - they do not exhibit common sense or judgement during execution. - Fuselets perform transformation and aggregation functions to transform data into knowls publish/subscribe mechanism. - Fuselets are part of the ""glue"" that makes the linkages that cause information in the JBI to flow to the right places in the right forms. - Fuselets use JBI's Structured Common Representation (SCR), and are often designed to be pertinent to particular object types (like squadron) and levels (like wing level). - Tools are needed to configure, monitor, manage and repair fuselets and their associated information structures during execution. - Relevant COTS/GOTS technologies include the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), ontologies, agents and agent-markup-languages, Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), Common Object Model (COM), Distributed Common Object Model (DCOM), Visual Basic, Java/Jini, and JavaScript. However, in the implementation of fuselets, there exists the need to be mindful of security concerns (e.g., those associated with JavaScript and mobile code). The JBI Fuselet Server mentioned above is part of the JBIP that manages and executes fuselets. It utilizes a library of fuselets designed to support generic and mission-specific requirements for which the JBI is stood up. The typical information objects that a fuselet works with consist of a set of attribute/value pairs that can be used to express arbitrary data structures. Information objects have associated metadata attributes to aid in JBI query, subscription, and management (dealing with storage access and security) processes. Agent-based Technology Programs: Agents have been used for applications as diverse as information search, filtering, message routing, and network control. Commercial development of agent technology has focused largely on e-commerce applications such as web searching, is primarily focused on single-agent systems, and is generally immature for many defense unique requirements. Therefore, DARPA and AFRL are conducting research initiatives that focus on large-scale, dynamic, heterogeneous, multi-agent systems. Some representative programs are: - Control of Agent-Based Systems (CoABS): Focuses on developing and demonstrating techniques to safely control, coordinate and manage large systems of autonomous software agents. http://iso.isotic.org/Programs/progtemp/progtemp.cfm?mode=126 http://www.rl.af.mil/div/IFT/IFTB/coabs/coabs.html. - Autonomous Negotiating Teams (ANTs): Utilizes highly decentralized and autonomous negotiation of tasks, roles and allocations, to provide solutions for challenging distributed allocation problems http://www.rl.af.mil/div/IFT/IFTB/ants/ants.html - DARPA Agent Mark Up Language (DAML): Create an Agent Mark-Up Language (DAML) built upon XML that allows users to provide machine-readable semantic annotations for specific communities of interest and tools that embed DAML markup on to web pages and other information sources in a manner that is transparent and beneficial to the users. http://iso.isotic.org/Programs/progtemp/progtemp.cfm?mode=347 - Active Templates (uses agent technology): Develop lightweight planning and execution management software to automate military operations, maintaining a causal model of the situation and providing incremental payoff as new automated functions are added and the causal model is improved. http://iso.isotic.org/Programs/progtemp/progtemp.cfm?mode=332 The Composition Problem: The Dynamic Assembly for Systems Adaptability, Dependability, and Assurance (DASADA) Program is a FY 2000 new-start initiative sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to address current deficiencies in the composition of systems. DASADA technology will enable system architecture refinement with guarantees that critical system properties will be assured through design principles that guide the selection, adaptation, and dynamic run-time assembly of appropriate system components. DASADA adopts a three-faceted concurrent engineering paradigm for adaptable, dependable, and high assurance mission critical systems: Continual Design, Continual Coordination, and Continual Validation. In this model, components are selected or constructed, and customized and evaluated before system assembly (Continual Design), during system assembly (Continual Coordination), and after system assembly (Continual Validation) to ensure that they can and do operate together with the rest of the system, in its current context, and within tolerated bounds. Continual Validation is particularly essential for assured applications because assurances that may have been met at initial system design time may not prove to be appropriate for field conditions, which are subject to rapid change while the system is running. Such applications typically cannot be ""taken down"" for long reengineering or enhancement cycles, but must be dynamically assembled in response to feedback from run-time gauges of functional and non-functional system properties. Two necessary bases for all three facets of dynamic assembly are: (1) being able to precisely determine and usefully specify the room for variation in components and their composition, and (2) being able to measure that components fit, and continue to fit, together as system and context change, within functional and non-functional tolerances permitted by dynamically evolving system requirements. The measurement probes must be insertable into legacy as well as new components and compositions, and ""displayable"" to humans and automated agents as useful and quickly interpretable gauges to prevent inappropriate system assemblies, and to trigger re-assemblies promptly when needed. More information on the DASADA Program can be found at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/tech/programs/dasada/index.html http://schafercorp-ballston.com/dasada/index2.html http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=HTMLCBD_ALL&docid=cite=SN475649. PRDA Approach: It is anticipated that offerors will investigate and apply COTS (e.g., XML) and GOTS (e.g., DASADA) technologies to incrementally develop a component-based framework comprised of capabilities for the development (scripting language and tools), execution (rule/constraint monitoring and enforcement mechanisms), and management (JBI Fuselet Sever/Library functions) of JBI fuselets and associated components (information objects, other JBI clients, and the JBIP). It is envisioned that: (a) agent technology will play a major role in the development of JBI fuselets, and (b) the DASADA Program will provide many of the technologies (e.g., Architecture Design Languages (ADLs), design-time and run-time gauges, and tools for dynamic assembly/re-assembly) required to ensure that fuselets are designed to properly operate together, operate with other JBI clients, and operate with JBIP core services in the context of the JBI SCR and dynamically changing JBI mission requirements. AFRL requires innovative, yet demonstrable and usable solutions to meet the needs of this PRDA. Technical solutions should emphasize the use of open systems that accommodate distributed, modular, and extensible approaches. Deliverables will be technical reports, robust software prototypes and demonstrations. Additional information concerning this PRDA 00-09 can be found at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/prda.prda-main.html. Principal funding of the PRDA and the anticipated award of efforts as a result of this PRDA will start in 2Q FY01, and will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending on the nature of the work proposed. Individual awards will not normally exceed six (6) months in duration with dollar amounts normally ranging between $50K to $250K. Total funding for exploratory development and demonstration under this PRDA is anticipated at $1.2M over four (4) fiscal years. Offerors are encouraged to submit one or more white papers that address exploratory development with demonstrable results. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit (5) copies of a 15 page (or less) white paper with a cover letter. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: James R. Milligan, Reference PRDA-00-09-IFKPA, AFRL/IFTD, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title. Period of Performance, Cost, Name of Company, White paper type; Section B: Effort objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609. Also, Small Businesses only should send one (1) copy of the cover letter only (1st Class Mail, Unclassified Only) to ATTN: Ms Janis Norelli, Director of Small Business, AFRL/IFB, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of the PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submission. Evaluation of proposals and white papers will be performed using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance, 1) Overall scientific and technical merit, including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, 2) Related Experience - the extent to which the offeror demonstrates technology and domain knowledge, 3) The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and 4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract. It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is excluded at the prime contract level. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistics Service Center at 1-800-352-3572. The work to be performed may require a SECRET/NOFORN facility clearance and safeguarding capability, therefore personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET/NOFORN information at the time of award. The cutoff date for submission of white papers is 18 Oct 00 for FY01, 15 Oct 01 for FY02, 15 Oct 02 for FY03 and 15 Oct 03 for FY04. This PRDA is open and effective until cancelled. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from offerors or potential offerors for this announcement. Routine questions are not considered to be ""significant concerns"" and should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer, Joetta A. Bernhard, (315) 330-2308. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Contracting Officer or Program Manager, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreement and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Ralph M. Lentz, Lt Col, Chief, AFRL/IFK at (315) 330-7746. When requested the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman should only be contacted with issues or problems that have been previously brought to the attention of the contracting officer and could not be satisfactorily resolved at that level.

Design a stand in two sections to fit around the vertical stabilizer of an F-16 aircraft. The stands will be used by structural maintenance personnel to aid in painting the aircraft. 2. With the exception of fastening hardware and work platform decking, the stands need to be constructed entirely of aluminum. Structural members, guardrails, and handrails are 2-inch OD 6063-T832 or 6061-T6 tubing, the stair treads are 5052 aluminum; all castings are 356-T6 aluminum. No plastic, fiberglass, or composite materials are used in the work stand structure. The platforms are fabricated using an aluminum structural support frame and decked with 1/ 2 inch plywood. Corrugated sheet aluminum covers the plywood for added durability and slip resistance. 3. The majority of the structural subassemblies comprising the work stand are fabricated where by the tubing is cold formed (swaged) to the joint castings. Welds on the work stand are in accordance with American Welding Standard D1.2 and are accomplished by welders certified to the specification. 4. Assembly of the work stand can be accomplished without the use of cranes, forklifts, or any special tools; to include no major onsite fabrication (drilling, cutting, welding, etc.). Structural frames and guardrails utilize a snap hook method (cast aluminum hook with a spring pin); frames are connected using horizontal and diagonal braces. Maintainers must be able to disassemble the stand for repairs if needed. Access to and egress from the work stands is by means of a stairway. 5. Positioning of the work stands around the aircraft easily and safely accomplished by 2 to 3 people. The work stands need to have casters with polyurethane wheels.

Bernhard, Contracting Officer, 315-330-2308 email: Joetta.Bernhard@rl.af.mil. This announcement is republished for the convenience of industry. NOTE: The BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 01. No changes have been made in the technical content, although minor changes such as office symbols, etc., have been updated. Audio/Speech Processing AFRL/IF is soliciting white papers for research and development in audio and speech processing technology. Basic research and engineering solutions using new and innovative approaches will be sought. This BAA addresses the development of technology for in-house and advanced development programs to satisfy DoD and law enforcement requirements for (1) Message Sorting and Translation; (2) Interference Reduction; (3) Voice Countermeasures; (4) Jam-Resistant Communications; (5) Man-Machine Interface; and (6) Background Sound Identification. A description of these six areas of interest are as follows: (1) MESSAGE SORTING AND TRANSLATION -- Technology is being sought for the automatic sorting, routing and translation of messages. Robust automatic speech recognition (automatic speaker, language and event/activity) techniques and methods are sought for use in tactical (Avg. 9 dB signal-to-noise ratio, <5 seconds recognition time, minimum training time) environments. In addition, fusion of other pieces of data with speech recognition results is also of interest. Finally, papers related to voice to voice language translation are also sought. (2) INTERFERENCE REDUCTION -- Technology is being sought to reduce/remove interference from audio signals in tactical communications. The signal of interest may be either voice, Morse code or data. Interferences are undesired signals and noise. The removal process must be on-line, real time and work without humanintervention. In addition, the techniques shall require minimal training and be effective in negative signal to noise ratios. (3) VOICE COUNTERMEASURES -- This area includes techniques such as voice concatenation, synthesis, and transformation. Techniques that perform with limited training data, and in noisy environments are sought. (4) JAM-RESISTANT SPEECH COMMUNICATIONS -- Of interest is the development of low bit rate speech communication algorithms for multiple bit rate jam resistant communications. Papers should address techniques below 2400 bits/second and be applicable to the tactical (noisy, preserve speaker identity) environment. (5) MAN-MACHINE INTERFACE (MMI) - AFRL/IF is developing MMI concepts to meet tactical audio processing requirements. These requirements are hands busy/eyes busy, and are becoming more complex as additional capabilities are added. Of interest are the development of new MMI techniques and strategies to improve efficiency and reduce errors for these applications. Since there are multiple applications and tasks, it is also of interest to understand the interrelationships between various workloads (visual, manual, oral, etc.) and input/output modalities for transportability of techniques to other tasks within the same or different domains. Of high interest is the ability to identify tasks where speech synthesis and recognition are appropriate modalities and provide a means for estimating their performance. (6) BACKGROUND SOUND IDENTIFICATION -- This technical area seeks new and innovative techniques to identify sounds based on features extracted from an analysis of the background noise. This technology area is also for tactical use (Avg. 9 dB Signal to Noise Ratio, <5 seconds recognition time, minimum training time). Deliverables for each area of this BAA will be technical reports, and when appropriate, demonstrations. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a five (5) to seven (7) page white paper. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company, Section B: Task Objective, and Section C: Technical Summary. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Daniel Benincasa, Reference RL-BAA 97-07-PKPX, AFRL/IFEC, 32 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4114. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submissions. Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: (1) The Overall Scientific and/or Technical Merits of the Proposal, (2) Applications to Tactical Speech Processing, (3) Innovative Approach and/or Techniques, (4) Compatibility with RL In- House Efforts, (5) Cost Effectiveness and Consistency. No further evaluation criteria will be used to determine whether white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Evaluation will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY 98. Individual awards will not normally $100K to $1000K. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Total funding for this BAA is not expected to exceed $6.2M from all sources. Foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point for information if they contemplate responding. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18. The work to be performed may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. Routine questions are not considered to be ""significant concerns"" and should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer, Joetta A. Bernhard, 315-330-2308. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer or program manager, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Lt Col Ralph M. Lentz, Chief, Contracting Division, at 315-330-7746. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. An informational briefing is not planned. This BAA is open and effective until 36 months after publication of this announcement. To receive a copy of the Rome Laboratory ""PRDA & BAA: A Guide for Industry"" (Sep 96 REV), write to, AFRL/IFK, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514, or it may be found at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/baa/.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation, No. F02604-00-T0591is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document, incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-14. This acquisition is 100% Small Business Set Aside; SIC: 9511; Size Std.: $5 million. CLIN: 0001; NONPERSONAL SERVICES to provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and services necessary to comply with the following: BIO-REMEDIATION SERVICES TO TREAT WATER CONTAMINATION, LUKE AFB, AZ. This statement of work is for the requirement to remediate water contaminated with TRPH and grease, which is collected in oil/water separators, holding tanks, grease traps, and waste water collection piping transferring contaminated water from its sources to wastewater treatment facilities. This shall be done with the use of microbes that will reduce the contaminates and the preventive maintenance activity. The product will be the latest generation of microbial bacteria identified as 637-HC and 327-GT: not to compare to less effective enzyme process. This work specification establishes the minimum requirements to provide bio-remediation services to treat water contamination of total recoverable petroleum hydrocarbons (TRPH) in oil water separators and grease in grease traps Luke AFB, AZ. There are three general sources for the contaminates to enter the oil/water separators/traps: sinks, paved surfaces such as the aircraft ramp with associated aprons and roads, and drains and food preparation facilities. The objective is two fold. First reduce the contamination to below Environmental Protection Agency standard 418.1 at the effluent from the wastewater treatment plant by commencing and sustain the cleaning process from the source throughout the system. Second, obviate the need to periodically contract removal of oil contaminates from the oil water separators, holding tanks and grease removal from traps for disposal at authorized landfills or processing facilities. The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment; tools, materials, supervision and services necessary to treat contaminated wastewater. Reducing the TRPH count to less than 100 parts per million (PPM), phenol compounds to less than 5 parts per billion (PPB). Grease collected to particle count to EPA standards through the process where microorganisms will metamorphize the contaminates to a by-product of water and carbon dioxide. Contractor will install peristaltic pumps at 32 locations (22 for TRPH and 10 grease), and 16 (TRPH) manually fed locations where contaminates originate. The pumps/time dissolve cakes will introduce bacteria to the drain lines carrying the contaminates to the separators/traps. These process and digest contaminates adhering to the surface drain lines as well as those TRPH contaminates in the separators or grease in traps. A container filled with 327-HC/327-GT hydrocarbon will be installed with a battery-operated pump under a sink, near a drain. For those sites where a sink is not available, the contractor will construct a unit to provide a complete enclosure. No visible openings for equipment and products, and install it next to site where bacteria will be added. The pump is designed to release a predetermined amount daily. Contractor personnel will schedule replenishment of the container to ensure uninterrupted insertion of microbes to drain lines. Contractor must provide a complete enclosure shelter with no visible openings for all equipment that is not located inside of a facility. The contractor guarantees the bio-remediation process will successfully accomplish the objectives within the stated parameters. The contractor reserves the option to introduce alternate methods for treatment to enhance the process. The contractor will evaluate all grease traps to determine if they require pumping, then report locations that require pumping to necessary personnel. The contractor will have an Arizona certified analytical laboratory, perform quarterly tests for Phenols and TRPH after oil water separator #912 and before treatment at wastewater treatment plants to ensure meeting or less than stated limits. The contractor will perform all services in accordance with local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS, INCLUDING THE DUE DATE, REMAINS THE SAME. REQUEST FOR INPUT FROM INTERESTED SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES - In August 1999, CDC created the Comprehensive Information Technology Contract Work Group, composed of representatives from the CDC's Centers, Institutes, and Offices (C/I/Os) to develop a recommendation as to the strategic direction CDC/ATSDR would follow for programming and microcomputer IT contractor support and services. The goal was to produce a decision document to serve as a tool to: establish a shared understanding of contracting considerations reviewed by CDC, provide management with available alternatives; and recommend alternatives for contracting mechanisms that can best achieve CDC's mission. The Work Group conducted research and evaluation of available information in order to recommend a contracting approach that would be the most advantageous method for CDC to procure a large CDC wide information technology support services contract. In addition, based on input from the work group members, 21 questions were drafted for industry response, and a Request for Information was published in the Commerce Business Daily. CDC received responses from 24 vendors that addressed the questions included in the RFI. Based on the research and evaluation of different types of vehicles, following are the six contract alternatives, that the work group agreed would be evaluated: (1) Two Single Award Contracts, (2) Two contracts, each with separate scopes and multiple awards to several contractors, (3) Multiple award, Government Wide Acquisition Contracts, (4) Single Scope/Single Prime Vendor (with Subcontractors), (5) Multiple Contractors/Single Scope, and (6) Multiple Scopes/Multiple Vendors. The Work Group Decision Document Sub-Committee developed the preliminary document and submitted it to the work group with recommendations for the first and second choice alternatives. The Work Group recommended to CDC's management one comprehensive contract with a single prime vendor and a single scope of work - combining programming services and microcomputer services - as the best approach for CDC to follow. Two awards with a single prime vendor, one with a microcomputer scope of work and one with a programming services scope of work was recommended as the second best approach for CDC. Further, it was recommended that the contract be flexible enough to allow task orders to be issued as fixed price, T&M, etc. Both alternatives should provide for a manageable environment in which protection of information and systems can be woven readily into CDC's collaborative efforts, from conceptual design to ultimate returement of a system. To promote flexibility and continuous competition, both of these contracting alternatives are non-requirements, and allows CDC to choose other contracting vehicles, e.g., GWACs. As a result of the approval of CDC management for a single award, non-requirements type environment using full and open procurement procedures, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a draft request for proposals for the acquisition of information systems development and microcomputer support services followed by a final RFP issued on or about 01/01. The contract, anticipated to be awarded in 10/01 will be a single award, ID/IQ Task Order type contract with the flexibility to award cost plus fixed fee, fixed price, time and materials and labor hour task orders dependent on the scope of the statements of work associated with the task order. The contract will not be a requirements type contract. The period of performance is 7 years with a basic period of performance and annual option periods not to exceed 84 months. The estimated number of hours for the effort is 9,079,000. CDC is pursuing a contract that will include programming services scopes of work which heretofore were small business set-asides in Cincinnati, Ohio and Morgantown, West Virginia, as well as the inclusion of the newly awarded, 2 1/2 year CDC-wide Microcomputer Support and Services contract also awarded as a total small business set-aside. CDC will request approval of the bundling of these scopes of work from the Small Business Administration and pending their approval will issue the final RFP with these scopes included in the RFP. Anticipated release time for the Draft RFP is late August, 2000. The work under this contract is anticipated to consist of a variety of programming and microcomputer support services to CDC and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) for various information systems technologies and computing platforms which includes mainframe, microprocessor workstation, and network server technologies and client-server applications. Work involves information and data analysis systems in support of CDC's mission, for performing requirements analyses; design and development of new systems; ensuring information systems security; modification, maintenance and conversion of existing systems; data and database administration; training users in both CDC-developed and commercial applications; hot-line user support to application users such as CDC staff and state and local health professionals throughout the U.S. in the use of CDC-developed applications; programming support for the analysis of scientific, statistical, and public health data; systems integration, data conversion, and data communications via networking and telecommunications between disparate systems and geographic locations; data entry and keypunch support; graphics and desktop publishing; and computer center facilities operation. Work to be performed also includes hardware repair and maintenance of Government microcomputer equipment; maintaining a spare parts inventory; software support including installation, integration, operation and user orientation; local and wide area network administration and support; problem diagnosis and tracking including maintaining a CDC-wide Help Desk; and video teleconferencing support. Existing technology is primarily Pentium-based microprocessors and installed microcomputers run Windows 95 and NT which are connected to IBM token ring and Ethernet Local Area Networks (LANs) running Novell NetWare version 4.11 operating system (soon to be upgraded to 5.x). CDC plans to migrate to Novell NetWare 5.x in the near future, and to Sonet ring in the next 12 - 18 months. CDC's network topology is a combination of token ring over type 1 cable, FDDI over category 5 cable, and Ethernet over type 1 or category 5 cable. Supported protocols are TCP/IP, IPX, and SPX and CDC interconnects to the Internet. The LANs are connected together into a Wide Area Network (WAN) using multi protocol and high speed routers over fiber optic cable or leased data lines. A broadband Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) interconnects all large Atlanta campuses. Currently FDDI is the method used for the WAN. Within a 12 -18 month period, the WAN will use ATM over T-1 and the MAN will migrate to an OC-48 network. Offerors must be capable of repairing and maintaining equipment from a variety of manufacturers, i.e., Dell, Compaq, AST, SUN microcomputers, with a few MacIntosh. Contract performance will be at CDC's primary offices in Atlanta, GA as well as in Washington, DC; Cincinnati, OH; Morgantown, WV; Hyatttsville, MD; and Research Triangle Park, NC, as well as in the contractor's facilities. Travel may also be necessary to other CDC sites such as Anchorage, AK; San Juan, PR; and occasional travel outside the United States. The draft solicitation will be available on or about August 31, 2000. Written or electronic comments only. Provide comments not later than 09/18/00. Comments will be included in our SBA request for bundling document. Comments should specify RFP 2000-N-00120. Telephone comments will not be considered. Point of Contacts: CDC: Deborah S.

Bernhard, Contracting Officer, 315-330-2308; (Joetta.Bernhard@rl.af.mil). AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches in the following two topic areas. 1) WAVEFORM DIVERSITY FOR AMTI/GMTI/IMAGING APPLICATIONS. The objective of this task is to develop and demonstrate spatially and temporally adaptive RF sensor technology for application to air, space, and ground systems operating in isolation or in concert with other sensor systems. Environmental awareness is critical to the process of spatial and temporal adaptivity via transmit waveform diversity. Any sensor incorporating this technology must be capable of sensing sources of electromagnetic radiation such as other sensor systems, communications and navigation signals, and selecting regions of the spectrum best suited to the mission(s), given the surveillance region, coverage and revisit requirements, as well as the EM environment. Appropriate waveforms and parameters are selected accordingly. Spatial-temporal adaptivity adds several unique features to radar systems. Namely, it provides the ability to deny a coherent sidelobe reference signal to an off-mainlobe enemy receiver desiring to operate in a non-cooperative bistatic mode of operation or attempting to intercept communications signals. The integration of joint adaptivity on transmit and receive provides spatial-temporal modulation. This allows the radiation of signals with different information content in various directions and full adaptivity on receive. This is fundamental to advance multi-mission sensor concepts. This includes a formed mainlobe for radar applications in one (or more) direction while simultaneously communicating with field units, fighting forces, and field commanders in other directions. Spatial adaptivity methods will be investigated and evaluated for monostatic and bistatic applications to radar AMTI, GMTI and imaging applications. Spatial adaptivity will be investigated in the context of combining radar operation at selected angles with the embedding of communications or navigation signals at other angles. Finally, the adaptive radar signal processing algorithm(s) must work in conjunction with the added spatial-temporal adaptivity. Appropriate algorithms shall be developed to work in concert with waveform diverse radars. (POC: Mr. Paul Antonik, AFRL/SNRT, 315-330-7057; Paul.Antonik@rl.af.mil.) A related topic area is: 2) COMMONALITY AMONG MULTI-MISSION ADAPTIVE RADAR ALGORITHMS. The objective of this task is to establish a set of parameters, which describes the various modes of operation in emerging airborne/space borne radar technologies. Additionally, focus on the detection of advanced threats, or threats under cover, will be emphasized. There is a growing need to improve interference (clutter and jamming) rejection not just in the angle-Doppler sidelobes, but in the mainlobe as well. Improved target (air and ground) detection will also be achieved under this effort. This leads to polarization as a natural discriminant in the development and demonstration of these adaptive radar signal-processing algorithms. Furthermore, the integration of polarimetric processing with multi-channel adaptive processing (STAP) offers an opportunity to optimize degrees of freedom selection and processing domain (element space versus beamspace, multi-channel feed reflector systems versus fully populated and adaptive phased arrays, etc). Additionally, compatibility of the filtering process (STAP) with the (CFAR) detection process (as well as discrimination) is essential in this effort. In the initial stage, parametric analysis will be used to optimize performance. For different radar configurations and geometries, variation in coherent dwell, degrees of freedom, and waveform parameters, are essential segments in signal processing optimization. Specifically, the focus of this effort shall be on multiple modes of operations for air targets, ground targets, imaging and SIGINT missions. The need to interleave waveforms modes further compounds problems in the signal/data processor, since one unit will have to perform all functions under all modes of operation. As such, adaptive algorithms are to be included in the suite of algorithms under consideration. Finally, the algorithm suite developed under this effort must be applicable to space radar systems designed to operate in either multi-sensor or single sensor configurations. (POC: Dr. Braham Himed, AFRL/SNRT, 315-330-2551; Braham.Himed@rl.af.mil.) Demonstrations utilizing the AFRL Surveillance Facility are permitted and encouraged under this BAA. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a three (3) to four (4) page white paper with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, woman-owned, small business, Historically Black College or University, or Minority Institution. Small business should only send one (1) copy of the cover letter only (1st Class Mail, Unclassified Only) to ATTN: Ms Janis Norelli, Director of Small Business, AFRL/IFB, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; Section C: Technical Summary.

White papers will be accepted until September 30, 2005. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent award. Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under the announcement. Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: a) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, b) The innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, c) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, and d) The Government will consider other factors, such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to perform the requirements of the effort. The criteria used to evaluate proposals will also be used to determine whether white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government. Only (a), (b), and (c) above will apply to white papers. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY-00 Individual awards will not normally range from 6 months to 36 months with dollar amounts ranging from $25,000 to $250,000 per year. Total funding for this BAA is approximately $4.8M. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submissions. All responsible firms may submit a white paper, which shall be considered. Responders are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission as well as a fax number, and an e-mail address.

The contract is anticipated to be a single award, ID/IQ Task Order type contract with the flexibility to award cost plus fixed fee, fixed price, time and materials and labor hour task orders dependent on the scope of the statements of work associated with the task order. The contract will not be a requirements type contract. The period of performance is 7 years with an anticipated basic period of performance of 12 calendar months from date of award with six one year option periods not to exceed 84 months. The estimated number of hours for the effort is 9,079,000. At the present time CDC is contemplating the contract will include programming services scopes of work which heretofore were small business set-asides in Cincinnati, Ohio and Morgantown, West Virginia, as well as the inclusion of the newly awarded, 2 1/2 year CDC-wide Microcomputer Support and Services contract also awarded as a total small business set-aside. CDC will be requesting the bundling of these scopes of work from the Small Business Administration and pending their approval will issue the final RFP with these scopes included in the RFP. The work under this contract is anticipated to consist of a variety of programming and microcomputer support services to CDC and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) including various information systems technologies and computing platforms including mainframe, microprocessor workstation, and network server technologies including client-server applications. Work involves information and data analysis systems in support of CDC's mission, including performing requirements analyses; design and development of new systems; ensuring information systems security; modification, maintenance and conversion of existing systems; data and database administration; training users in both CDC-developed and commercial applications; hot-line user support to application users including CDC staff and state and local health professionals throughout the U.S. in the use of CDC-developed applications; programming support for the analysis of scientific, statistical, and public health data; systems integration, data conversion, and data communications via networking and telecommunications between disparate systems and geographic locations; data entry and keypunch support; graphics and desktop publishing; and computer center facilities operation. Work to be performed also includes hardware repair and maintenance of Government microcomputer equipment; maintaining a spare parts inventory; software support including installation, integration, operation and user orientation; local and wide area network administration and support; problem diagnosis and tracking including maintaining a CDC-wide Help Desk; and video teleconferencing support. Existing technology is primarily Pentium-based microprocessors and installed microcomputers run Windows 95 and NT which are connected to IBM token ring and Ethernet Local Area Networks (LANs) running Novell NetWare version 4.11 operating system (soon to be upgraded to 5.x). CDC plans to migrate to Novell NetWare 5.x in the near future, and to Sonic ring in the next 12 - 18 months. CDC's network topology is a combination of token ring over type 1 cable, FDDI over category 5 cable, and Ethernet over type 1 or category 5 cable. Supported protocols are TCP/IP, IPX, and SPX and CDC interconnects to the Internet. The LANs are connected together into a Wide Area Network (WAN) using multi protocol and high speed routers over fiber optic cable or leased data lines. A broadband Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) interconnects all large Atlanta campuses. Currently FDDI is the method used for the WAN. Within a 12 -18 month period, the WAN will use ATM over T-1 and the MAN will migrate to an OC-48 network. Offerors must be capable of repairing and maintaining equipment from a variety of manufacturers, i.e., Dell, Compaq, AST, SUN microcomputers, with a few MacIntosh. Contract performance will be at CDC's primary offices in Atlanta, GA as well as in Washington, DC; Cincinnati, OH; Morgantown, WV; Hyatttsville, MD; and Research Triangle Park, NC, as well as in the contractor's facilities. Travel may also be necessary to other CDC sites such as Anchorage, AK; San Juan, PR; and occasional travel outside the United States. The draft solicitation will be available on or about August 31, 2000. Only written requests submitted to the address shown above will be honored. The date specified for receipt of questions/comments on the draft RFP will be approximately 30 days after the draft RFP issue date. Requests for the draft RFP must cite RFP 2000-N-00120. Telephone requests will not be accepted. It is anticipated that the final RFP will be issued January, 2001. CDC will announce the industry day/pre-proposal conference schedule in another CBD notice."

The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is soliciting proposals for new concepts, tactics and tools to support effects-based operations. The scope of this announcement is to acquire necessary technologies and their integration to support an Effects-Based Operations (EBO) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD). The specific goals are to: a) develop an operationally oriented framework for EBO which includes EBO term definitions, indicators of effects, differences and similarities between EBO approaches and others, and application examples of EBO, b) provide tools and techniques to support the warfighter in planning, executing and assessing effects-based campaigns, c) integrate the effects-based tools and techniques into an EBO dynamic tasking toolkit and d) assess the effectiveness of the toolkit through a series of measured experiments and exercises. The scope of this ATD covers a broad range of technology disciplines, including but not limited to collaborative planning & assessment, modeling & simulation, knowledge-based representation and problem solving, targeting, and infrastructure support which includes agent, database, middleware and visualization technologies. Specific capabilities of interest to the EBO ATD include: a) efficiently determining effects-based campaign strategy, b) improved planning leading to more accurate specification of logistics requirements both physically and temporally, c) developing synchronized campaign and combat assessment requests for information (RFIs), d) enabling ""what if"" analysis of strategy/task options to optimize use of joint assets, e) integrating lethal/non-lethal Information Operations (IO) methods in a common framework, f) focusing/leveraging Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) assets in campaign assessment (e.g. are we accomplishing objectives), g) supporting rapid development of high quality target sets, h) developing indicators of battle damage, i) supporting re-targeting in light of battle damage, j) providing automation support for building both strategy and assessment plans, k) supporting generation of tasks to drive the Master Air Attack Plan (MAAT)/Air Tasking Order (ATO) process, l) providing a continuous monitoring capability with links to operational databases, m) providing a drill-down feature that allows rapid response to General Officer/decision maker questions, n) providing critical information for development of support plans, o) supporting the rapid collection/display of accurate, relevant information for decision making, p) integrating analysis tools into C2 systems and the decision making process, q) enabling predictive C2, r) providing realistic ""train as you fight"" environment. AFRL requires innovative, yet demonstrable and usable software solutions to meet the need of the EBO ATD. Technical solutions should emphasize the use of open systems that accommodate distributed, modular, and extensible approaches. Deliverables will be technical reports, robust software prototypes and demonstrations. Additional information concerning this Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) Program, including a Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) for Effects- Based Operations, can be found at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/prda/prda-main.html. It is intended that multiple awards be made under this PRDA. The subject PRDA is soliciting two types of proposals: Type 1 - Technology Proposals and Type 2 - Integration & Assessment Proposals. Type 1 proposals are to address the EBO operational framework and/or technology in support of EBO (items a and b stated as specific goals above). Type 2 proposals are to address: a) the development of a technical architecture framework for tool integration, b)the integration of the EBO technology tools, c) the development of EBO experiments/exercises and d) the measurement of the EBO toolkit in the context of the experiments/exercises. Offerors submitting Type 2 proposals are prohibited from submitting Type 1 proposals. Offerors may submit multiple Type 1 proposals. Only one Type 2 award will be made under this PRDA. Principal funding of the PRDA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY01. Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months in duration with dollar amounts normally ranging between $250K to $3.5M. Total funding for the PRDA is $20M. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. An informational brief will be held at Air Force Research Laboratory on 11 Jul 00 in the auditorium of Building 106, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY at 9:00 AM. Please notify Ms Carla Burns if you will be attending at (315) 330-2638 or email: burnsc@rl.af.mil. Offerors are required to submit (5) copies of a 15 page (or less) white paper with a cover letter. Small Business only should send one (1) copy of the cover letter only (1st Class Mail, Unclassified Only) to ATTN: Ms Janis Norelli, Director of Small Business, AFRL/IFB, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title. Period of Performance, Cost, Name of Company, White paper Type; Section B: Effort objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Daniel F. Fayette, Reference PRDA-00-06-IFKPA, AFRL/IFTB, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of the PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submission. Evaluation of the Type 1 proposals and white papers will be performed using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance, 1) Overall scientific and technical merit, including familiarity with effects-based operations, how the proposed technology addresses the needs of the EBO CONOPS, the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, 2) Related Experience - the extent to which the offeror demonstrates technology and domain knowledge 3) The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and 4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). Evaluation of the Type 2 proposals and white papers will be performed using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance, 1) Overall technical and management plan for a) developing a technical architecture framework for tool integration, b) integrating the EBO technology tools, c) developing EBO experiments/exercises, and d) assessing the EBO toolkit in the context of the experiments/exercises, 2) Offeror's demonstrated capability to successfully integrate various technologies (i.e. adaptation, scale-up) and successfully conduct experiments (i.e. evaluation and technology demonstration), 3) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract. It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is excluded at the prime contract level. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistics Service Center at 1-800-352-3572. The work to be performed may require a SECRET/NOFORN facility clearance and safeguarding capability, therefore personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET/NOFORN information at the time of award. The cutoff date for submission of white papers is 3 Aug 00 for FY01, 20 Aug 01 for FY02, 20 Aug 02 for FY03 and 20 Aug 03 for FY04. This PRDA is open and effective until cancelled. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from offerors or potential offerors for this announcement. Routine questions are not considered to be ""significant concerns"" and should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer, Joetta A. Bernhard, (315) 330-2308. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Contracting Officer or Program Manager, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreement and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Vincent Palmiero, Deputy Chief, AFRL/IFK at (315) 330-7746. When requested the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman should only be contacted with issues or problems that have been previously brought to the attention of the contracting officer and could not be satisfactorily resolved at that level.

The helmet must protect the user, integrate with life support/escape systems, and enable employment of weapons systems within their performance envelope to maximize combat capability. It must allow users to safely operate in normal (as defined in mission profiles; Air to Air, Air to ground, etc...) as well as adverse conditions at designed aircraft flight performance envelopes and allow safe, virtually injury free ground egress, ejection, and/or bailout. The helmet must be maintained on the user through speeds compatible with current and planned ejection seat capabilities and its weight must be within safe human design limits (i.e. neck loads) when fully assembled with internal and external components. It must protect the member's head from impacts and penetrations associated with basic aircraft maneuvers as well as ejection and bailout. It will be required to integrate with all current aircrew life support and chemical/biological equipment and serve as a platform for current and planned cueing systems, night vision capability, and laser eye protection. It must be stable, within center of gravity standards, comfortable to the user, accommodate prescription eyeglasses (with appropriate eye relief), and not cause muscle fatigue/strain during normal or emergency use. The helmet should take advantage of new design/construction materials which are fire retardant, impact resistant, increase service life, decrease inspection cycles, and decrease size/weight. The helmet must accommodate the 1 to 99 percentile flying population.

The planned NDGPS network will provide precision navigation coverage throughout the continental United States and Alaska and will consist of approximately 81 geographically dispersed sites. Eight NDGPS sites are currently operational with the remainder planned for construction / conversion by 2004. The Coast Guard also plans future integration of the existing network of Maritime Differential Global Positioning (MDGPS) sites into the _Nationwide_ system for a total of approximately 135 sites. Services required to maintain the NDGPS network at a 99.7 percent operational availability will include a 7x24x365 call center for casualty reporting and response, preventative and corrective electronic maintenance for medium frequency radio transmitters, GPS reference receivers, integrity monitors, antennas, couplers, and towers. Services to maintain auxiliary support systems at NDGPS sites are also anticipated. These include maintenance and support for emergency power generators, fuel cells, batteries, lighting, air conditioning, ventilation systems, grounding, safety and protection systems, sensors, and remote monitoring equipment and some incidental facilities and grounds maintenance to include mowing, vegetation control, weeding, fence and gate maintenance, access road maintenance, snow removal, and site security. Typical NDGPS sites are being constructed at former USAF Ground Wave Emergency Network (GWEN) sites and selected new locations throughout the United States. An average site occupies approximately 11 acres of real estate -- primarily in rural areas. The typical NDGPS site will have three equipment shelters, miscellaneous support equipment, fire and security sensors, and safety equipment. The primary equipment suite consists of the following items: medium frequency transmitter, antenna coupler and 300_ top-loaded guyed transmitting antenna; two GPS reference station receivers with antennas; two DGPS integrity monitor receivers with antennas; GPS antenna masts (10_ to 30_ tall); remote monitoring equipment and sensors; data router and modems; UPS and battery back-up components; emergency diesel generator, integrated fuel cell, and power transfer panel. Security clearances will be necessary for a contractor to perform work under any future contract for the NDGPS system maintenance. The Coast Guard is currently in the process of developing specific requirements for this maintenance program. As of yet the type of contract has not been decided although it is anticipated that some of the maintenance may be fixed price and other work may be performed on a time and material or cost reimbursement basis. The Coast Guard envisions the future contractor(s) having an intricate network of technicians dispersed in selected localities that could respond to a casualty within a few hours as dispatched from its central 800 call center. Vendors should have experience with maintenance and repair of similar equipment as will be required in any potential future solicitation. No solicitation for this requirement exists; therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Government Electronic Posting System at www.eps.gov and in the CBD. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these cites for release of any future solicitation or synopsis. Vendors having capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought synopsis including commercial market information and company information via e-mail to the Contract Specialist at jthorne@mlca.uscg.mil. Responses should include the following information: company name, address, point of contact and phone number; business size and disadvantaged, 8(a) or HUBZone status; corporate affiliations; potential joint venture partners, teaming partners, and or major subcontractors or (prime). All relevant input is encouraged. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited; no basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this Sources Sought or Government use of any information provided.

The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division is seeking innovative solutions for the development of automated tools to exploit MTI data and incorporate information fusion from current and future sensor systems. This will offer the warfighter an enhanced operational capability to automatically exploit MTI data in order to locate, identify, and track high value ground moving targets. Current MTI exploitation techniques are manual, operator intensive, and very limited. This effort will also provide algorithms to enable the optimal fusion of resources for the timely detection, track, and identification of ground moving targets. There are currently more targets than resources in any concept of operation so that adequate optimization of resources is critical to being able to engage moving vehicles. This MTI exploitation BAA will focus on the following technology areas: ground moving target tracking, motion pattern analysis, behavioral pattern analysis, geo-registration, feature aided tracking, multiple platform tracking, and resource allocation and scheduling. In the area of ground moving target tracking, innovative algorithms are sought to allow current surveillance platforms to automatically track targets in a variety of background environments. Motion pattern analysis tools may also be developed to analyze MTI tracks and identify entities or groups of entities that may be of military significance. Examples of this include the detection of convoys and formations, determination of sources and sinks via traffic flow analysis, and determination of lines of communication. Behavioral pattern analysis tools are needed to determine the intent of entities or groups of entities based on terrain, doctrine, and historical data. An example would be the determination of a probable hide site for a missile launcher based on measurements indicating the launch site. Geo-registration is needed to accurately determine target location by reducing tacking errors from different sensors, specifically registering RF tags and images from multiple platforms. Feature aided tracking may be developed to track targets based on certain features, some of which include velocity, vehicle type (track vs. wheels), HRR, and ISAR. Multiple platform tracking will improve target recognition and location by utilizing MTI data gathered from various sensors. The combination of these technologies will provide a powerful tool set for operators to exploit MTI data and will enable the creation of a more comprehensive picture of the battlespace. Finally, in the area of resource allocation the focus will be that of moving target indication and the scheduling required to detect, track, and exploit moving targets whether the target be airborne or ground based. The scheduling algorithms will be capable of being integrated into the Air Forces Time Critical Targeting Cell for the real time allocation of resources to assist in the detection, track, and identification of time sensitive targets. The scheduling algorithms may also be integrated with the targeting assignment toolbox, namely the Joint Targeting Toolbox. Information fusion will require the gathering and processing of information from various sensors, platforms, and multiple systems to include MTI fusion with HRR reports, imagery, and SIGINT. Advanced concepts for information fusion technology, which includes multilevel sensor/platform/system resource management, central/distributed fusion management, and database information management, also need to be developed to achieve this goal. Multilevel sensor/platform/system resource management is needed to provide a seamless environment for the user. This involves global resource management where platform cueing and fusion of various sensors, platforms, and/or integration of multiple systems will provide extensive data. Central/distributed fusion management may include optimizing data distinctiveness, defining mechanisms for information push/pull, and defining levels of responsibility. Database information management needs to be enhanced by concepts of robustness such as model-based reasoning, context sensitivity and efficiency. The database support to the algorithms needs to be upgraded by concepts such as client/server relationships that take advantage of object oriented software. New parallel techniques must be explored to allow implementation of algorithms for real time use. This effort seeks to leverage existing technologies such as the Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) Multi-Platform fusion algorithms and develop a resource scheduling algorithm analyzing terrain blockage, cross cueing capabilities, revisit rates, and detection accuracy. The Air Force currently can schedule sensor resources such as Joint STARS and Global Hawk in real time using dedicated communication links between the ground stations and the platforms. Currently no cross cueing is being performed optimizing coverage and the information flow between platforms. The same goes for space assets as well, where timeliness of the data is more of an issue because of the collection times associated with space assets. However, space assets provide a new foundation in that they provide consistent coverage of hostile target areas over a continuous 24 hour cycle. This provides for normalization to be developed over the movement patterns associated with normal operations. The effort will leverage existing developments in the operational area such as the Time Critical Targeting Aid and Moving Target Indicator Exploitation (MTIX) and develop on these architectures making it easily adaptable to existing architectures for technology transition. From all aspects of information fusion technology, measures of performance and measures of effectiveness need to be developed and integrated into these new concepts. This will provide methods for consistent world views. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerers are required to submit an original and three (3) copies of a ten (10) page or less white paper with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, women-owned small, or small disadvantaged business, or Historically Black College, University, or Minority Institution. Small business offerors must also send one (1) copy of the cover letter only, by First Class mail (DO NOT SEND CLASSIFIED), to AFRL/IFB, ATTN: Janis Norelli, Director of Small Business, 26 Electronic Parkway; Rome NY 13441-4514. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to AFRL/IFEA, ATTN: Rick Gassner, Reference BAA 00-01-IFKPA, 32 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4114. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. White papers are due for FY00 not later than 15 December 1999. It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY01-30Jul00; FY02-30Jul01; FY03-30Jul02; FY04-30Jul03. White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each Fiscal Year after the dates cited. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submission. Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: a) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, b) The innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, and c) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees. In addition, the Government will consider other factors, such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to perform the requirements of the effort. The criteria used to evaluate proposals will also be used to determine whether white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the proposals. Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Principle funding of this BAA and anticipated awards will start approximately FY00. Individual awards will not normally exceed 24 months in duration, with dollar amounts normally ranging from $100K to $1.5M. Total funding for this BAA is $24.0M. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Foreign-owned offerors are advised that they are excluded from participating at the prime contract level. Foreign or foreign-owned offerers should immediately contact the contracting focal point, Joetta A. Bernhard, for information if they contemplate responding.

That is, these applications are not constrained by the processing speed or memory, but rather the inability of the memory system to deliver the requested data in a timely manner. This research seeks to leverage and transition the revolutionary results from DoD sponsored investigations including DARPA's Embedded Computing, Adaptive Computing, Data Intensive Systems, Applied Computational Mathematics, and Low Power Computing Programs, the DoD High Performance Computer Modernization Program (HPCMP), and the BMDO Discriminating Interceptor Technology Program (DITP). By leveraging research from the aforementioned programs, newly developed memory architectures that manage the placement and flow of data, as well as manipulate data in the memory subsystem itself may provide the basis for information fusion architectures capable of real-time ID/Position estimation, situation assessment and threat assessment. Two areas of specific interest are (1) development of the hardware requirement tradespace identifying existing bottlenecks in fusion processing and the relevant new architectures that would affordably enable/enhance fusion capability, and (2) design and development of such architectures for DoD fielded systems. Technical solutions and/or approaches should emphasize the use of open systems that accommodate distributed, modular, and extensible approaches to address fusion processing deficiencies within current and planned Air Force systems. Deliverables will be technical reports, published papers, presentations at conferences, and when appropriate: feasibility models, prototypes, and/or demonstrations. Such applications may include, but are not limited to, Information Fusion, Multi-Dimensional Signal Processing and Knowledge Bases. Other than the intent to focus the application domain on Affordable Fusion and Exploitation Architectures, all other information as presented in the original 24 Apr 98 PRDA announcement remains valid. Submission of white papers for initial consideration is requested by 10 December 1999. All addresses, evaluation factors, etc. remain as originally published."
