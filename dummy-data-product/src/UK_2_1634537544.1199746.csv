It will also contribute to the existing evidence-base on refugee integration and help to guide the future New Scots approach in Scotland.A range of potential questions for the evaluation have been identified, both in relation to the evaluation of the New Scots strategy (Table 1) and the evaluation of the AMIF-funded projects (Table 2), which provide a starting point for types of questions the evaluation should seek to answer. The questions draw on the evaluation questions set out in the MEL framework and cover three key areas: process, outcomes, and learning.It should be noted that the questions identified do not need to be taken as a definitive list, but should instead act as a guide to the sort of questions we would anticipate the evaluation to address in order to meet the overarching aims outlined above.
