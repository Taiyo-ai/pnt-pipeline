The skate bowl was designed and installed in Kennington Park in 1978, part of the revolutionary design known as ""Radical Banking"", which used a system of pre-cast concrete banked and flat-slab elements to create a skateable bowl.

Over the years the slabs have differentially settled and become mis-aligned. In 2012 an attempt to repair and add to the existing facility was made, with a nominal concrete skim to the top with some new additional skate ramps. Whilst this temporarily dealt with the gaps between the units from differential settlement, this has now cracked leaving the facility in a worst state of repair than before. Causing issues with drainage and cracks in the joints and un-level surface.  The original concrete slabs had moved exposing many large gaps between the slabs.  Due to the issues posed with health and safety the bowl was subsequently closed to the public.

The intention now is to renovate the bowl and bring it back into normal use

Contractors are invited to submit priced proposal for the renovation of this iconic facility.

Current status

The Camden and Islington Community Stop Smoking Service (CISSS) has been delivered as a joint service since 2017. Both councils are committed to providing evidence-based services that treat tobacco dependency effectively, help smokers to stop smoking, reduce smoking related health harms and inequality, support residents to stay healthy, and ensure children have the best start in life. The CISSS will contribute to the reduction of smoking prevalence, and as a result increase the ability of communities to live healthier lives.

The CISSS model was developed after extensive engagement with stakeholders, and incorporates research from University College London. The model uses a three-tier approach to support (low intensity through to high intensity) to ensure smokers receive the best support to help them stop smoking.

The tiers of the service can be defined as: 
•	Tier 1 self-support through online or app-based information and printed media to those smokers who want to quit without face-to-face support. 
•	Tier 2 brief support (minimum two sessions) with appropriate medication provided by trained professionals in community settings. 
•	Tier 3 specialist support with appropriate medication to highly addicted smokers who find it harder to quit so can benefit from an intensive face-to-face intervention and behavioural support. 

The model has further adapted to take account of the COVID pandemic which resulted in some valuable modifications that received positive feedback from service users. 
The requirement
Islington Council wants to procure a service to support residents of Camden and Islington to successfully stop smoking. 

The broad aims of the Camden and Islington Community Stop Smoking Service will be to: 
•	offer a range of support options to smokers who want to quit, tailored to their needs and preferences.
•	ensure all smokers who want to stop smoking can access appropriate information, advice and stop smoking medications.
•	provide services that are accessible to all groups of the population who may benefit from them, with a specific focus on priority groups. 
The high-quality service will work with smokers aged 12 or older, who live, work, study or are registered with a GP in the London Boroughs of Camden or Islington. It will take referrals from a diverse range of sources across both Camden and Islington and be open access for all those eligible. It will need to develop and maintain strong partnerships with local NHS acute and mental health trusts to support treatment of tobacco dependency in line with the NHS Plan, ensuring robust referral pathways into the service. The service will also offer support and training to local GPs and community pharmacists commissioned to deliver stop smoking services through a separate locally commissioned scheme.",Opportunity,Open,"15 August 2022, 12pm",United Kingdom,"£3,985,800",30 June 2022,

In addition to the waste separation, the pilot will test ways to encourage householders to turn food waste into compost. The compost produced through this activity will be used either for home growing activity or be collected and used locally.  The pilot should look to test the approach in a variety of household types: high-rise flats and houses with gardens and houses with yards.  
      
      The successful provider will be required to demonstrate pre-existing links with the target community in Ladywood and a track record of working with disadvantaged communities. The provider will have experience of working with food waste to produce compost and have experience of working with communities to support growing activity.  The provider will have experience of how to encourage a permanent adoption of food waste separation activity as well as how to build an appreciation of the importance of food waste as a contributor to soil production/composting.  
      
      The provider will be required to develop a data collection methodology to report the amount of food waste collected and work with a knowledge partner to develop a methodology for calculating the amount of methane saved and the carbon saving as a result of food waste diversion from landfill. The data from these calculations will be shared with the contractor (BCC, including the Waste Management Team and the Public Health Food Team) and the H2020 Food Trails team.  The provider will also be required to deliver a formative and summative evaluation of all pilot activity. This will also require establishing links with existing composting projects in Birmingham to collect data from their activity to provide a compelling case to BCC Waste Management team.  The ultimate goal is to achieve a roll out of pilot activity across Birmingham.
      
      Applications from consortiums will be looked upon favourably, although the pilot will be led by a single provider who will be the accountable body for project activity.
      
      As specified in the Environment Act 2021, all councils will be required to make weekly collections of food waste from 2023, so the learning from this pilot is timely.
      
      The H2020 Food Trails project is led by the Council's European and International Affairs (E&IA) team with strategic and policy input from Public Health. Food Trails is being delivered over four years from October 2020 to September 2024.

Evidence suggests that Children begin to understand the world, and their roles within it, from a young age and career-related learning in primary schools can support children to start exploring the world of work and challenge stereotypes.  Previous pilot schemes, led by the Department for Education and other organisations, have identified a market for a programme for careers provision in primary schools. By conducting a comprehensive options analysis, it has been concluded that this investment would provide the most realistic opportunity to penetrate the sector. This will be a small-scale investment of £2.6m via a grant arrangement. (Split into £0.6m in 2022-23; £1m in 2023-24; and £1m in 2024-25). 

ESTIMATED VALUE:  £2,600,000 over 2.5 years. 

Programme Aims
The Schools White Paper commits that ""we will launch a new careers programme for primary schools in areas of disadvantage.""  The programme should support primary schools to use the Gatsby Benchmarks of Good Career Guidance, as a framework to develop an age-appropriate careers programme specifically targeting primary schools in disadvantaged areas.  

Outline Requirement  
-	Provide proposals for increasing primary school children's awareness of career/work opportunities with a clear and articulated focus on career exploration rather than specific career paths.
-	Have existing networks and strong links with the primary education infrastructure and employers (and an ability to scale up existing links if these are not already a presence across the EIAs).
-	Be able to adapt to the Gatsby Benchmarks of Good Career Guidance for use in primary settings to deliver age-appropriate careers experiences, including CPD for primary staff.
-	Have an engagement strategy supporting knowledge sessions with local employers which are tailored to inspire the primary school children and are relevant to labour market needs.
-	Be able to demonstrate continuous innovation to adapt to the needs and requirements of the students to the local environment. 
-	Be able to capitalise on existing links with employers and local expertise already available in, for example, Careers Hubs and the Enterprise Adviser Network. 
-	Provide opportunities to experience a variety of workplaces. Through activities like visits to local employers, virtual experiences and role plays, pupils can learn more about the work environment.
-	Seek to inspire pupils about the world of work, drawing on positive role models in a range of industries and sectors to help raise aspirations, challenge stereotypes, and help them to link their learning to jobs and careers.
-	Have a reporting tool able to capture progress and impact, aligned to the Gatsby Benchmarks.",Opportunity,Open,"27 July 2022, 11:59pm","North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands, East of England, London, South East, South West","£2,600,000","30 June 2022, last edited 30 June 2022",

Trusts are looking towards innovative solutions to help reduce their referral to treatment times and increase efficiency through better utilisation of their existing facilities.

NHS Trusts may find it difficult to meet referral to treatment (RTT) targets due to lack of capacity. Locum staff can fill gaps but Trusts still need to manage the patient pathway which may not be possible outside normal hours (e.g. evenings & weekends). On-site Surgical and Medical Capacity Solutions (sometime known as ""Insourcing"") will act in a complementary way to partially or totally manage the Pathway for referred Patients. 

This Framework Agreement will facilitate maximisation of in-house capacity to a level that the Participating Authorities can reduce the need for additional mobile facilities and outsourcing. At the same time, in-patient and out-patient waiting times will be reduced, referrals will be expedited, service quality will be improved and patient satisfaction will be positively impacted. 

The Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust's Commercial Procurement Service seeks to introduce a new, flexible commercial Framework Agreement which will allow UK public bodies to procure on-site surgical and medical capacity solutions. This will enable Participating Authorities to act quickly in realising efficiencies.

The services in scope of this procurement process are healthcare services which fall under 'social and other specific services' in Section 7 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 ('PCR') (as amended). In accordance with Regulation 76 PCR, the process is to set up a framework agreement and will follow a procedure similar to the open procedure. However, the Framework Manager and the contracting authorities using the framework are only bound by the parts of the PCR that specifically apply to social and other specific services. 

For the avoidance of doubt, the rules that apply to the open procedure under Regulation 27 and framework agreements under Regulation 33 do not apply to this procurement. All providers that meet the minimum requirements set out under the procurement process will be appointed to the framework agreement. There will be no maximum number of providers appointed.

The Framework will be re-opened to new applicants annually, approximately 90 days before the anniversary of the Framework Commencement Date. Previously appointed Suppliers will NOT be obliged to re-apply on an annual basis. Framework Suppliers appointed on the first anniversary of the Framework Commencement Date will be awarded a Framework Agreement of up to 3 years duration; Framework Suppliers appointed on the second anniversary of the Framework Commencement Date will be awarded a Framework Agreement of up to 2 years duration and Framework Suppliers appointed on the third anniversary of the Framework Commencement Date will be awarded a Framework Agreement of up to 1 year duration.",Opportunity,Open,"1 August 2022,  2pm",Any region,£0,"26 June 2021, last edited 29 June 2022",

The greenfield site has been vested in perpetual trust as open land for public 
playing fields. The area north of the access road has been demarcated for a new 
pavilion development. The playing fields are currently served by two sports 
pavilions which do not meet current standards, are not of adequate size and are in a deteriorating state of repair and condition. These existing pavilions are to be 
demolished outside of the main works contract.
 
The project proposes the construction of a modern and compliant two-storey sports
 pavilion which will accommodate: a first-floor clubhouse with a kitchen and 
external open viewing balcony, ground-floor changing rooms with associated 
showers, officials changing, separate toilets, storage, external bike shelter and 
bin store. The pavilion will also have a first-floor balcony viewing area. 
Landscaping includes alterations to the access route, car parking, drainage, paving and installation of EV chargers together with other associated works. 

Stride Treglown Architecture & Design Practice have developed a design which 
is attractive, of high quality, efficient and economical to maintain. It is hoped 
that the new Pavilion will serve the current and future needs of the clubs, players, officials and spectators of all ages, cultures, abilities and gender.

Please note the contracting authority intends to direct award the contract to the Christie NHS Foundation Trust. The case for direct award can be found on the tender portal.

GatewayC was initially created to support the Cancer Alliances and the CCGs in delivering the NHS Long Term Plan for cancer having established nationally that education is the key to improving early diagnosis in primary care. Over the course of the pandemic and with the changes in the NHS structure, GatewayC has grown and adapted to meet the needs of all its stakeholders whether they are primary care professionals, Cancer Alliances, NHSE policy makers, PCNs, HEE or universities. It is a highly reactive entity which is linked into national policy, can respond quickly to informational and educational needs, creates a forum for interpretation and debate, and vitally provides support and training to the workforce of the future. 

The Christie NHS Foundation Trust is the only organisation capable of providing the additional functionality and expertise to GatewayC to meet specific requirements of the Cancer and Diagnostics Programme. The Christie NHS Foundation Trust as the developer and host of the GatewayC portal has the requisite expertise and experience to assist HEE in fulfilling the solution driven functionality essential to allow further content on cancer to support earlier diagnosis of cancer and reduce the proportion of cancers diagnosed following emergency presentation.  Other suppliers who work in this area would need to redo and charge for work already completed in order to provide the same level of useability and functionality.

Description
In 2021, BEIS launched the Reforming Consumer and Competition Policy (RCCP) consultation.  The department asked for views on ways for government to address fake online reviews and proposed adding practices related to this to the list of automatically unfair commercial practices in Schedule 1 of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations (CPUTRs) 2008. 

Government plans to consult on the details of the developing policy proposals in due course. An impact assessment (IA) assessing the costs and benefits of the policy options is expected to be published alongside the consultation. This research is intended to help develop the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and inform the policy solution. It is expected that the outputs of this research will:
•	Improve understanding of the scale of the problem of fake reviews and how they impact consumers
•	Influence the development of the policy by testing potential solutions and ensuring policy making is evidence based
•	Provide evidence for the CBA which will assess the impacts of policy options, on both consumers and businesses.

The aim of this work is to understand: 
a)	The prevalence of online fake reviews for a pre-determined basket of goods on the most popular third-party UK e-commerce websites
b)	How online fake reviews influence consumer choice when making online purchases
c)	The consumer detriment that occurs as a result of fake reviews and how this varies by demographic groups
d)	The effectiveness of potential non-regulatory interventions in nullifying the harmful impact of fake reviews on consumer decisions

1.	have representation from all years of training and involve StRs, Academic Clinical/Public Health  Fellows (ACFs/APHFs), Academic Clinical Lecturers (ACLs) and Clinical Research Fellows (CRFs)
2.	have ten members (therefore approximately five in total in the region). 
3.	meet three times a year, each meeting to be for two hours
The AS will: 
1.	provide supervision, support and advice on an ongoing basis in relation to research projects.
2.	assist the StR identify their training and academic learning needs, develop appropriate strategies and identify resources to meet these needs.

The 'Key Working Function' has been developed as a response to the NHS England and NHS Improvement Long Term Plan(LTP) commitment that by 2023/24, children and young people with a learning disability, autism or both, with the most complex needs will have a designated Key Worker, implementing the recommendations made by Dame Christine Lenehan.  The purpose of the Keyworker service is to support children and young people and their families to navigate a complex system, have their voices heard, and have their needs met at the right time.

The East Berkshire Keyworker Service will be delivered in two phases:

•	Year 1: Keyworker support will be offered to Children and young people with a learning disability and autistic children and young people with most complex needs from ages 0-25 and their families, on the Dynamic Support Register as an inpatient or at risk of admission to a mental health hospital and 

•	Year 2: Keyworker support will be extended to those who face multiple vulnerabilities such as looked after and adopted children, and children and young people moving between services, like moving to adult services.

The contract is expected to be for 3 years with the option to extend for 2 further years and is anticipated to commence on the 1st January 2023.

This is a real opportunity for innovative and progressive providers to deliver a person-centred and needs based approach to support children and young people and their families. We are therefore keen to encourage providers of all sizes to take the opportunity to bid for this service.

The format of the event will be a presentation from the commissioners followed by Q&A for Bidders. The presentations will touch on the contract model, service specification, activity and finances.  We will be seeking views on appetite and ability to provide the service as proposed and will provide opportunity for open discussion and feedback.

CONTEXTE

1.	Informations générales 

Le Mali fait face à la pire crise alimentaire et nutritionnelle des dix dernières années. A peine sorti de la gestion de la pandémie à COVID 19 et ses implications sur sa population, le Mali est, depuis le 9 janvier 2022, soumis à un embargo économique, la suspension des aides financières et le gel des avoirs de l'Etat réduisant drastiquement ses capacités d'investissement. Cette situation a conduit à une ruée sur certains biens qui ont entraîné une forte inflation et des hausses de prix liés à l'effet psychologique des sanctions. 
Pour faire face à cela il est crucial de mettre l'accent sur les réponses d'urgences aux ménages vulnérables combinée à des actions de nutrition et de relance agropastorale pour soutenir la saison agricole 2022-2023.

C'est dans ce contexte que Lutheran World Relief a financé pour son partenaire l'Union des Sociétés Coopératives des Eleveurs de Tamani (USCET) le projet dénommé : « Projet de Réponse d'Urgence et de Relance Agricole- Sini Niè Sigui ». Le projet sera réalisé dans la région de Ségou dans le cercle de Baraoueli pour une durée de 12 mois (1er juillet 2022- 30 Juin 2023). Il a pour but de permettre aux communautés cibles d'affronter la crise alimentaire actuelle et faciliter l'accès aux intrants pour la campagne agricole à venir.

The successful tenderer will be responsible for not only the look and feel of the exhibition, but also any 3D structural elements and exhibition furniture, interactives and operational elements.  The designer will also be responsible for 2D graphi identity from concept to installation.  The NAM has display cases which we would like to re-utilise to keep costs down, which need to be resited in new walls.  The design should have a logical visitor flow that allows for visitors to understand the chronology within the themes.  All structural elements and exhibition furniture must be compliant with CDM regulations and H&S guidelines. Materials utilised need to have passed Oddy testing and be suitable for use with historic artefacts and agreed with NAM in advance.  Design solutions for the display of objects must be approved by the Head of Exhibitions at the NAM.  The look and feel of the exhibition must enhance the aims and themes of the exhibition narrative.

The successful tenderer is also responsible for the graphic elements of the exhibition, including title walls, text panels, object labels and large-scale imagery.  The successful tenderer should account for the production of visuals for presentation to NAM board members and also artworking graphic files to print from.  The successful designer will be required to liaise with graphic production companies to produce the graphics elements, including approval of proofs.  This is a complete design turnkey operation.
  
The designer will therefore be required to attend regular project meetings, some of which will be on site.  It is crucial that site visits take place on a regular basis to ensure that structures fit the space and the layout utilises existing socket and data outlets, whilst accommodating other fire requirements and security cameras within the space.

The visual identity of the graphic elements of the exhibition, should also take the NAM permanent galleries style guidelines into account, ensuring that all galleries have their own identity, yet work together as a cohesive whole. Graphic identity also needs to be translatable to marketing and public programming.  Therefore, the successful designer should be willing to make these elements available to other NAM departments.",Opportunity,Open,"1 August 2022, 10am",SW3 4HT,"£29,000",28 June 2022,

      Solent Transport successfully bid for FTZ funding from the Department of Transport. The objective of the FTZ programme is to test and trial innovative, digitally enabled shared transport services, modes and business models at scale to establish risk and benefits.
      
      The projects to be trialled as part of the FTZ programme are focused on 2 themes:
           1. Personal mobility 
           2. Sustainable urban logistics
      
      In addition, a behavioural change marketing and communications strategy will be implemented across the programme with monitoring and evaluation also undertaken to understand the impact and effectiveness of individual projects and collectively across the overall programme. Full details of the FTZ bid can be found at https://www.solent-transport.com/images/Bids/FMZ_EOI_form.pdf
      
      The DPS will be used over time to source a wide range of services, supplies and to a lesser extent works utilising a broad range of contracting forms and financing arrangements which will allow for award via contracts, concessions and grants. 
      
      Award of call off contracts may be via direct award or mini-competition.
      
      Whilst the establishment of the DPS is driven by the Solent FTZ programme, the agreement may also be used by Solent Transport as well as the Contracting Authorities located within the Solent region source related requirements which fall outside of the FTZ programme.  The Contracting Authorities able to access this DPS include:
           o Portsmouth City Council
           o Southampton City Council
           o Hampshire County Council
           o Isle of Wight Council

      The DPS may also be extended - subject to issue of a Corrigendum Notice - to cover additional geographical areas and allow access to further Contracting Authorities. 
      
      The initial advert for the DPS was published in February 2021 and has been operational since April 2021.  The initial term of the DPS will mirror the duration of the FTZ programme, which is due to end on 30th June 2024. However, the agreement may be extended beyond this term on a rolling basis in increments to be determined without limitation in respect of number and length of extension periods applied.

The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) regulates auditors, accountants, and actuaries; and sets the UK's Corporate Governance and Stewardship Codes. We seek to promote transparency and integrity in business; our work is aimed at investors and others who rely on company accounts, audit, and high-quality risk management. 
As the Competent Authority for audit in the UK, the FRC sets auditing and ethical standards, and monitors and enforces audit quality. The FRC will be transformed into a new regulator: the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (ARGA) in the future, following three independent reviews and recommendations, and the Government's 2021 consultation ""Restoring trust in audit and corporate governance""  and the Government's response to that consultation.

ABOUT THE RESEARCH PROJECT 

The aim of this research project is to further our understanding of how innovation and competition interact in the market for audit services. The FRC's strategic objectives for 2022-25 include promoting improvements and innovation in the areas for which we are responsible and creating a more resilient audit market through greater competition and choice.  The outputs of this research project will inform the FRC's work to drive up audit quality and improve the functioning of the audit market. 

We envisage that some of the outputs that will be delivered by this research project (included but not limited to):
-	A short literature and (secondary) evidence review. This should include:
•	a summary of any research on the links between innovation and competition in the audit market. For this research project we are concerned predominantly with the audit market for FTSE 350 companies but would also be interested in innovation-competition dynamics in any other parts of the audit market for UK Public Interest Entities (PIEs) or in audit markets elsewhere in the world.
•	a summary of the latest research, both empirical and theoretical, on the interaction between innovation and competition at a more general level. This does not necessarily need to be audit specific providing findings could be of relevance to the audit market. 
•	a summary of the available (secondary) evidence on innovations in audit since the previous work by the Competition Commission referenced above. 
-	Informed by the literature review and the evidence identified above, a short discussion paper with questions for discussion at the workshop (see below) with relevant innovation and competition experts. 
-	A small-scale structured (online) workshop with relevant innovation and competition experts from academia and other institutions such as think tanks and regulators (including the FRC). 
-	A short, written report.

It is anticipated that the provision of additional facilities will support a reduction in Out of Area Placements; the short stay facility may also reduce quick re-admissions and support emotional resilience and guidance to tackling wider health demographic challenges that are impacting mental health and wellbeing.

These services are split across two Lots:

Lot 1: Short Stay Recovery Houses, Norwich

The short stay facilities aim to provide a safe, recovery focused supportive and collaborative alternative to acute mental health hospital admission, for people with issues that may affect their mental health. The facility and provider will work closely with the Norfolk and Suffolk Foundation Trust (NSFT)'s Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment (CRHT) teams.

The service aims to support and provide interventions in the least restrictive environment consistent with people's health and social care, and safety needs. Equity of access to an alternative to admission for people is ensured. 

Lot 1 cover the existing location already in place, in Norwich. The contract term for Lot 1 is an initial term of 5 years and 1 month, with an option to extend services for up to a further 2 years.

The majority of the 25-hectare site is in council ownership. Funding has been secured through Getting Building Fund to remediate the ground conditions across a first development phase (approx. 6 hectares), which can be accessed via a new purpose built access off Salthouse Road.

The south and east of the Marina Village site require additional enabling works, presenting a viability challenge for private developers. The Council has secured £1.5m to provide an upgraded junction to the south west of the Marina Village site connecting Cavendish Dock Road to Strand / Salthouse Road and to relocate a new substation and utilities diversions on the east of the site. These interventions remove two major constraints on further private sector development.

The project is at a stage where it requires a detailed design to be undertaken with associated additional survey and investigation works to enable the project to be let for construction by competitive tender via the Chest. Planning permission will also be required as Cavendish Dock Road is currently not adopted and due to its setting in relation to a number of listed buildings.

This project scope details the Services required to
1) enable the upgrade of the existing Cavendish Dock Road/Salthouse Road junction to a fit for purpose right turn priority junction (as detailed within the existing concept design).

      Our ambition is to create new venues on the historic waterfront which can be commercially let as food and beverage offers.  This transformation will be led by our internal Major Projects team and accompanying stakeholders in an approach that will enhance the current offer to visitors to the Liverpool Waterfront.  This is to be achieved through refurbishing and developing the buildings as dedicated spaces for food and beverage offers to be operated by commercial partners. The buildings and offer must complement the historic environment on the waterfront as part of NMLs overall vision. 
      
      NML is looking for a team that is creative, innovative, diverse, highly skilled, and experienced, and able to deliver the project in line with the programme timescales. The team will need to demonstrate experience and an understanding of developing a project within listed buildings for commercial purposes.  Accordingly, the multi-disciplinary team must be able to demonstrate experience of working with Grade II or above listed buildings such as ours and the ability to create a design solution that will provide a realistic and future-proofed solution in the face of climate and biodiversity crises, including effective adaptation and mitigation. The team must have experience of delivering sustainable buildings and/or refurbishment projects to the highest standard and the ability to deliver a building sustainability plan which includes the integration of both climate change mitigation, adaptation measures and minimisation of operational cost.",Opportunity,Open,"12 July 2022, 10am",L3 8EN,"£125,000 to £160,000","9 June 2022, last edited 28 June 2022",

This notice specifically focusses on the Mobility Hubs project, which is part of the FTZ programme.
Mobility Hubs are modern multi-modal, multi-functional, flexible, and inclusive interchanges and destinations. They are places that integrate established and new forms of travel (personal and freight) with infrastructure, traveller facilities and information, urban realm, and community and commercial activities. Operating as a network, hubs have a consistent and recognisable design and appearance but are individually tailored in scale, form, and delivery to meet local community and business needs.
More details on the project can be found at https://www.westofengland-ca.gov.uk/what-we-do/transport/future-transport-zone/mobility-hubs/ including a link to a short video explaining the concept. https://youtu.be/UxLQtZ4t_HI
Mobility Hubs are a relatively new concept which are rapidly gaining traction in the transport and urban planning sectors  because they help to: 
•	raise the profile of and access to shared and sustainable mobility services, 
•	reduce reliance on private car use and ownership, and 
•	provide opportunities to improve the public realm
CoMoUK is one of the leading organisations developing guidance and best practice on Mobility Hubs and further information about mobility hubs can be accessed via their dedicated webpages: https://como.org.uk/shared-mobility/mobility-hubs/what/
Project scope
The project will deliver 13 mobility hub sites across Bristol and South Gloucestershire's Northern Arc. The intended locations are mapped on Google maps at: https://tinyurl.com/k5s634zw
The West of England Combined Authority is seeking to procure a supplier, designer, contractor, or a consortium or partnership of those organisations who can:
•	Develop a Mobility Hub design
•	Project manage the overall supply of mobility hub components, and carry out their installation and maintenance
•	Collect and share data around the use of mobility hub components where this can be collected digitally via the component itself (for example: mobile device charging; solar generation; use of any bookable features)
Develop a Mobility Hub design
Create an overall mobility hub detailed design using the Combined Authority's preliminary designs as a starting point, incorporating the desired components, and considering the stated design principles and must also provide a final design for the delivery of the site.

Specifically, we would like to assess the LR pilot scheme in England and the removal of Direct Payments over the agricultural transition period. How are farmers preparing for the changes and challenges ahead? Are they engaging with LR? Are they participating in the pilot? Are they planning to expand, diversify or to leave the industry or have they made any plans to mitigate the loss of direct payments? 

There is a high level of interest amongst farmers and growers in knowing how the new ELMs policies will/could work and how it could impact their finances. This project is about providing farmers and growers an understanding of how the LR policy proposals could impact their business and help explore ideas of how to prepare for the change. AHDB is also keen to learn about the views of farmers and growers that are not taking part in the LR, as well as where they receive information regarding policy change and in which format. 

The aim of this project is to inform farmers and growers of how farm businesses are adapting to the changes in policy. Related to this are the following objectives:
•	What are the key factors LR participants have taken into consideration in their planning that others can learn from? 
•	How do farmers expect LR will impact on their farm business finances - what are the expected costs and benefits?
•	Is there a difference in attitude between the more progressive farmers/growers and others?
•	What are the farmers attitudes towards collaborating on environmental issues?
•	How do farmers feel LR could be improved?
•	What are the barriers to participating in LR?
•	How is the collaborative partnership managed? 
The number of participants in this study should be skewed towards those that are taking part in the LR. AHDB requires in-depth qualitative information from these participants, and this may be obtained via case studies. The following sectors need to be represented:
•	Beef
•	Sheep
•	Pork
•	Dairy
•	Cereals and Oilseeds
In total, AHDB expects at least three in-depth qualitative reports/examples covering the criteria outlined above and at least one in-depth qualitative report of a large-scale group of farmers, such as within a National Park or similar who have chosen not to participate in LR. Please note that this study due to its size is not intended to be representative of the agricultural sector in England. The intention of the project is to capture initial views and plans regarding LR and is not expected to provide a comprehensive analysis of the scheme.

AHDB invites applicants to provide details/methodologies regarding the identification and recruitment of farmer participants on which the qualitative reports will be based. However, AHDB will assist with locating participants if required.

The scheme has been well received overall and has supported six hospitality businesses, five of them within the closure area, by creating an outdoor seating area. It provides space for visitors and residents to socialise in an outdoor environment as a current pandemic measure and also supports long term city centre vitality and vibrancy.

The street is challenged by its current street scene layout and surface condition, and it is yet to achieve its full public realm potential.

Therefore, Oxford City Council are commissioning feasibility design and engagement work to build on the success of the current scheme and explore opportunities to create an exemplary permanent pedestrianised zone which enhances the city centre public realm.

OCC have undertaken preliminary work, so this brief incorporates the current understanding of technical requirements, headline constraints and opportunities, an initial stakeholder list and engagement scope. It is an OCC project, however Oxfordshire County Council (""County"") as highway authority, will be key stakeholders throughout, alongside other local landowners and interest groups. If a permanent scheme is to be delivered, it will need to be approved by County, however that stage is outside of the scope of this project.

BACKGROUND
The FRC is a public body, and a partner body of BEIS.  Although funded by member and levy contributions, not by the taxpayer, the FRC is subject to public sector requirements and engages closely with other regulators and public bodies.

The UK Stewardship Code is a voluntary code for asset managers (investment managers), asset owners and service providers (such as proxy advisers, investment consultants and data providers). The Stewardship Code promotes the responsible allocation, management and oversight of capital to create long-term value for clients and beneficiaries leading to sustainable benefits for the economy, the environment and society. 

We also monitor and take action to promote the quality of corporate reporting and operate independent enforcement arrangements for accountants and actuaries. 

PROJECT & PURPOSE
Following the UK's exit from the EU and UK auditors' loss of automatic statutory audit rights, the FRC (as competent authority responsible for approving third country qualifications) is seeking to secure several mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) with key countries around the world. 

Via a process of engagement with a number of countries we have identified some priorities and have focused, in particular, on the qualifications of accountancy professional bodies in Australia and New Zealand with the intention of reaching MRAs with the authorities in Australia and New Zealand later this calendar year. 

We are currently reviewing the audit qualifications of Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ) and CPA Australia (CPAA) relevant to the approval of their qualifications by the FRC as approved third country qualifications under section 1221 Companies Act 2006. Although Australia and New Zealand are likely to be the earliest MRAs that we are able to achieve, we are seeking an Independent Expert able to assist subsequently in assessing the qualifications of other countries with whom MRAs are agreed. 

OUR REQUIREMENT

To appoint an independent expert to review the evidence we have identified, the conclusions we have drawn and report on the equivalence of the CAANZ, CPAA and audit qualifications granted by UK recognized qualifying bodies. 

This authoritative report will state whether in the opinion of the author the audit qualifications granted in Australia and New Zealand are comparable to UK qualifications. The report will be carried out with full academic rigour and will be impartial. Accordingly, it will provide assurance to the FRC Board, the accounting profession and government as to the equivalence of the qualifications concerned.

consortia who will deliver the service through a series of sub-contracts or partnership
arrangements. The Provider[s] will engage, collaborate, and work with other organisations
to deliver a broad range of interventions and support options that meet the needs of carers
and their families.

solutions that will offer quality services and support and value for money
The service aligns with the vision, aims and priorities set out in the soon to be published

A number of studies have highlighted the importance of maintaining a connection with a person who has self-harmed as a protective factor against repeated suicide attempt. Individuals who are admitted to the emergency department or attend their GP with suicidal ideation or deliberate self-harm are at high risk of attempting or re-attempting suicide after discharge. As described in the National Suicide Prevention Strategy and National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Safety in Mental Health, continuity of care and smooth transitions can minimise this risk.

The Psychological Medicine Service Safety Planning Outreach Work is a pilot project and part of the Wave 4 Suicide prevention work. It is for those adults who have been assessed by the East Berkshire Psychological Medicine Service as safe to be discharged back to primary care following an episode at A&E for self-harm or suicidal thoughts and deemed safe to work on their safety plan with the Primary Care Safety Planning Outreach worker(s).  

The aim of the service is to offer a follow up to support with developing a safety plan and making a connection with relevant community support services for the individuals referred.

Safety plan interventions will focus on support options in the individuals' own community drawing from Third Sector services, Local Authority provision and Primary Health Care services. 

The Safety Planning Outreach will be a face to face follow up whenever possible. Online and telephone contact can be used where required and this will also depend on the persons preference and any pertinent risks identified in any face-to-face interventions. 

The Safety Planning Outreach Worker(s) will in collaboration with other community resources: 
•	Promote connection and reduce isolation
•	Improve coping skills
•	Signpost to other services and sources of support
•	Provide educational strategies to help with difficulties that triggered self-harm

Crucial to the role of is an awareness of local Third-Sector services, grass root services and other primary care services. The intervention can be delivered by a skilled individual who has experience of working with people with mental health issues or lived experience. The worker(s) do not need to be registered mental health workers.

The service will not provide psychological therapy or crisis support and it is not an emergency service. It is an additional rather than alternative service for support and encourages people to engage with a safety plan. As such, as long as a individual is not already receiving support from secondary mental health services (an exclusion criteria based on the higher support needs of secondary mental health service users); there is no contraindication to existing plans.",Opportunity,Open,"25 July 2022, 12pm",South East,"£156,000",27 June 2022,

The box office generates income between £500,000 and £1m per year depending on the programme.
      
      It's vital that the Ticketing Solution Provider understands that we've made the business decision to introduce Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM, and for this reason also recognises that the cost of changing from our current CRM solution would be prohibitive to our business. For this reason, it is vital that the Ticketing Solution offered to us can be fully integrated with our existing CRM infrastructure, and not override or attempt to replace any of the core functionality we have chosen to utilise. For example, Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM is the principal system for managing Patrons and Members. We also utilise Dynamics 365 Customer Voice (Surveys) and Dynamics 365 Marketing (Email Marketing, Events Management), and the Ticketing Solution must be able to work with these key tools. We're also looking to make further use of integrations where possible such as between Ticketing Solution and Point of Sale and Event Management System.

The VRU has established a multi-agency, public health approach to understanding, tackling and reducing violence.  

The VRU benefits from a Data and Evaluation Lead, a Victims Lead and a Community-Led approaches Coordinator.
A key aspect of the Violence Reduction Unit is supporting the development and growth of the evidence base regarding 'what works' to tackle serious and youth violence to contribute to the local and national understanding.  
An element of developing this evidence base is facilitated by funding from the Home Office to Police forces, known as  'Grip Funding'. This funding stream allows police to trial innovative methods to mitigate, and suppress violence.  Monitoring data generated from this activity in order to evaluate effectiveness of interventions is a function of the VRU.  
The VRU has undertaken a comprehensive strategic needs assessment to develop a Greater Manchester wide, multi-agency focused action plan, which must be maintained and updated annually.  Delivery against the action plan is achieved through multiple VRU funded projects delivered through four workstreams (Criminal Justice, Education, Health and Wellbeing and Communities) which comprise the whole programme of work.  A Research and Evaluation Steering Group oversees all of the research work across the VRU including the prioritisation, monitoring and managing of outputs related to the successful provider of this specification, which the provider will contribute to and report into. 
The VRU is seeking a research and evaluation partner to build on the work of the VRU over the past three years across all workstreams, delivering high quality evaluation of selected projects; this includes the completion of a number of evaluations of projects which have been running for some time.  In addition, the provider will support in the ongoing overarching monitoring and evaluation of the VRU itself, developing and enhancing products to support this. The provider will provide research, evaluation and consultancy services to enable the VRU to effectively measure success and impact.  
The provider should ensure a regular presence in the VRU, including attendance at relevant team meetings, as well as delivery workstream meetings and Research and Evaluation Steering Group meetings.  Within the VRU, the provider will assist in the monitoring and evaluation of the whole work programme.  Identification and prioritisation of the themes and outputs required will be determined in partnership with the provider, based on the requirements as set out in this specification.
The provider will work closely with workstream leads and commissioned providers to implement and deliver robust evaluation, and provide an advisory role around research, monitoring and small level evaluations more generally.

An 18-month pilot (ends October 2022) across three of the ten GM Local Authority areas (Bolton, Salford and Manchester), has focused on providing immediate interventions when young people present at A & E departments (or have been admitted), followed by advocacy to ensure appropriate longer term local support is offered and accessed.
 
The three areas selected were based on demand and established partnership support for the pilot.      
Short term additional Home Office funding has also allowed us to test a model of community-based referrals and interventions which include referrals from North West Ambulance Service and post incident targeted outreach work. Between1 May 2021 and 31 May 2022 there have been 374 referrals into the Hospital service. 
Between 1Sept 2021 and 31 May 2022 there have been 81 community referrals in addition to a number of outreach deployments and roadshows.

The current team, which incorporates the community work, consists of 8 Navigators with admin and management support.  The current Service will cease on 31 Oct 2022, with the new Service beginning 1 Nov 2022. It is expected that the appointed provider bidder will be in a position to mobilise alongside the current provision in September / October 2022. 

A three year Home Office funding settlement to support the GM Violence Reduction Unit has created an exciting opportunity for the expansion and development of the Hospital and Community Navigator Service from November 2022 to March 2025.

- Take a strengths-based and trauma informed approach to care/support that has an outcome focus.
- Use agreed and appropriate outcome measure tools.

We seek to promote transparency and integrity in business; our work is aimed at investors and others who rely on company accounts, audit, and high-quality risk management.

The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is growing in actuarial modelling. The Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA), the UK's professional association for actuaries, has been encouraging education and training in these techniques among its members and recently launched a data science certification

The objective of this research is to learn more about the role of AI/ML in UK actuarial modelling practices across pensions, life insurance, general insurance, and wider fields (e.g., banking and investment). It will also compare the extent of AI/ML deployment by the actuarial profession with that of other similar professions. The overall purpose of the research is to improve our understanding of new risks that AI/ML might bring to the quality of actuarial work. To do this, the research will address the following four areas of enquiry: 

1.	Areas of use: Which actuarial departments are involved in using AI and ML techniques in their work? 
2.	Approach: What approach(es) and technique(s) are used? How are they selected? 
3.	Governance: What is the governance process around the use of AI and ML techniques as compared to the governance process around the more traditional techniques?
4.	Output: How do the areas of use, approach and governance of AI and ML impact on
a.	the way outputs are used internally by a company, and
b.	the uncertainty around the actuarial modelling results using AI/ML, as compared to the uncertainty around results from the more traditional approaches?

Potential providers may join the DPS at any time up to the date the DPS expires so long as the potential provider meets the criteria stated in the documents found on the appointed esourcing platform (Atamis). If a potential provider meets the criteria for admission to the DPS and is appointed to a lot then it may be invited to tender for the award of one or more contracts. UKHSA envisages using specific criteria which may, where appropriate, be formulated more precisely in the Invitations to Tender for those procurements. 
For LFT requirements UKHSA does not seek to procure kits which are exclusively nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal or exclusively both.

This builds on our joint commitment with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to ensure that institutional arrangements governing the energy system are fit for purpose for the long term.
Ofgem recently launched the review with a call for input, setting out and seeking evidence and views from stakeholders on the suitability of current and planned institutional and governance arrangements in place for delivery of energy system functions (energy system planning, real-time operation of local energy networks and market facilitation of flexible resources) and potential alternative arrangements.  To facilitate input from stakeholders on the case for change and potential reform options, Ofgem included in the call for input sample framework models for alternative arrangements. These sample models range from relatively small changes such as governance reforms within existing institutions to drive effective delivery of energy system functions, to more significant reforms including reshaping the roles of existing institutions or setting up new institutions.
Our next step is to compile perspectives and evidence on the case for change and further develop reform options through broad stakeholder engagement.

SERVICE TYPE: LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES**

**SECOND MARKET ENGAGEMENT EVENT REARRANGED - SEE BELOW FOR DETAILS**

We have provided high-level detail on service requirements below - please see Attachments for further information (also available on Jaggaer).

Multiply is a new programme aimed at improving functional numeracy skills across the United Kingdom. Multiply is aimed at all adults over 19 who do not already have a Level 2 Maths Qualification (or equivalent) - whether in employment or unemployed. They can either be working towards a Maths GCSE or Functional Skills qualification or equivalent, need specific numeracy skills for their work or progression, or just want to brush up on the skills to help them get on in life and work. 

A critical pillar of the programme is the Multiply national digital numeracy platform which will be launched later in 2022. The platform will act as the national ""front door"" to Multiply - giving people the ability to learn at their own place and pace. Through the platform, we want to build the confidence of learners, and help them take the stepping stones towards a maths qualification. We also intend to signpost to course in local areas. We'd also like to see employers using the online platform, e.g. through helping them assess their workforce needs, and signposting to local training.

This requirement therefore has several components: a digital learning platform, platform content, and an online tuition offer. Across all three, we would like the platform to provide a diagnostic tool to assess skills levels (e.g. identify strengths and weaknesses) to help guide learners through the learner offer; and recognise a learner's progress.

The platform is funded from the 2022-2023 financial year, through to the end of the 2024-2025 financial year.

The Department is carrying out a Discovery that will continue to inform our assumptions on volumes and service requirements (including number of learners).

The platform should meet the Government's Service Standard to ensure it is secure, robust, and accessible. This includes accessibility to WCAG v2 AA standard, and Cyber Essentials Plus. This is in addition to the minimum service requirements associated with RM6219.

The platform, content and tutoring must also be provided in Welsh for users in Wales.  

Finally, we expect the Multiply site to be both Multiply, UK Government and DfE branded.",Early engagement,Open,30 September 2022,Any region,,"14 April 2022, last edited 23 June 2022",

It will directly contribute to increasing the number of girls that can read by age 10 and help shift the policy environment for out-of-school girls, with the aim to improve access to education for up to 1 million children and increase the number of girls in school. By educating girls and preventing them from dropping out of school, they are less likely to suffer early marriage, have greater reproductive choice, are less likely to die in childbirth and have more earning power.

Outcomes:
- Improved foundational learning outcomes in English and maths for girls and boys
- Improved transition for girls to lower/upper secondary and into other learning opportunities

GIRL will achieve the outcomes through improved pedagogy and English skills of teachers and through ensuring that the teaching and learning process and school environment is gender-responsive and inclusive. The programme will target two groups of the most marginalised girls 1) those at risk of dropping out school and 2) those already out of school, by holistically identifying and reducing barriers to schooling. Girls in school will be supported to stay in school, stay safe, learn, and transition through the system, whilst girls already out of school will be supported to either return to school or transition into other learning opportunities.

As part of the wider programme with a value of up to £60m, the FCDO are looking to establish and manage a Technical Assistance (TA) Facility. The current budget for this contract is up to £25m over 5 years between 2023 and 2028. If conditions are favourable, a possible increase in budget up-to £35m may be available. The facility will provide demand led technical assistance against two primary cross-cutting set of issues:

i. TA to improve the way teachers' teach. Focus on English language, pedagogy in English/Maths, GRP, inclusive teaching practise and assessments.

ii. Strategic advocacy and TA to raise awareness of girls' education. Improving the use of evidence, building partnerships and influence policy, budgeting and programming for girls, early childhood development and inclusive education.",Early engagement,Open,18 July 2022,SW1A 2AH,,23 June 2022,

A key facet of this change relates to the way data is used and this is underpinned by the planned migration of reporting to Power BI from platforms such as Business Object and SSRS.
We know that supporting our staff to improve data literacy will allow them to explore innovative and exciting solutions and test them with confidence, tackling the right challenges for our residents in the process.
Subsequently, WF have established a partnership with Multiverse and have launched the Data Academy, a fully funded programme; pitched at various levels of accreditation, to build in-demand skills and networks across the council, which will equip employees with the ability to conduct improved data analyses, interpret data, and identify priority areas for intervention.
Alongside this, the HR & Organisational Development team are in the process of commissioning various levels of excel training which will be available to all staff.
Where you come in:
As we transition towards a data self-service model and prioritise reports for migration, we want to take a 'whole systems' approach and ensure that staff across the council,; are provided with the appropriate upskilling opportunities. We believe that there are two areas of focus. Generic PowerBI training for the majority of staff at all levels and more technical training for our data professionals who will build and deploy self-service reports and dashboards and conduct data analysis to support the organisation to monitor performance and make data driven decisions.
This will help cement the cultural change required in the realm of data analytics and equip employees with the appropriate knowledge, skills and behaviors to ensure the planned transition is successful.
We want to further supplement the current learning opportunities available and envisage a phased and long-term approach to upskilling council staff in the use of Power BI by Power BI experts and would like to invite bids from reputable providers who have with a track record of successful delivery in this area.
Initially, our main objective is to ensure key staff from each of our 5 Directorates can master the basics of creating Power BI reports with a view to progressing into more advanced skills in this area over time.
We anticipate mixed cohorts, prefer classroom-based training and would likely tailor the content according to our specific requirements and local needs.

The council has previously operated two separate dynamic purchasing systems for day services, one for Older People, People with Physical Disabilities, Sensory Impairment, and people living with, Dementia and a second for people with Learning Disabilities. We have undertaken a number of market engagement and other stakeholder events which have helped shape the new combined specification, revised monitoring, and proposed contract.  We will now have one dynamic purchasing system for all day services called Positive Days - Day Services which will become operational from 1st October 2022. 
      
      The Council proposes a shift in practice in the delivery of day services for all client groups, based on the overarching aims, on feedback as well as national and local priorities and good practice evidence. Commissioned providers and WCC Commissioners will work together to deliver support based on the following principles:
      • be well and stay safe,
      • be independent and connected,
      • be supported.
      
      The new specification is based on a new model of daytime support called 'Positive Days' which is about putting in the right support to enable people to connect to their communities and live the lives they want to lead. There is a greater emphasis on accessing mainstream and universal services in the community, outcome focused and shorter-term support for some and longer-term support only for those who need it as well as flexibility of delivery.
      
      To reduce the need for re-applications, suppliers awarded contracts under the previous dynamic purchasing systems (DPS) are able to 'fast track' their applications.  Please see the tender documents for more information.
      
      As this is a DPS procedure, the Council will be open to new applications on a 'rolling basis' after the initial closing date.

As such the full regime set out in the regulations will not apply to the award of the contract. Consequently, the procurement process adopted by the Commissioners has been developed in accordance with Regulation 76 of the regulations and in particular in accordance with the fundamental public procurement principles of transparency and equal treatment.

To surface learning from the current work within the Pillar and provide recommendations to be able to inform improvement to strategic approaches that will strengthen delivery (by each implementation partner and across the portfolio, to all applicable outcomes and objectives) over the remaining 2.5 years and support adaptive management decision making.  

Evaluation Objectives: 

To provide an external validation of progress towards the stated objectives and outcomes and assess whether the programme is on course to achieve its targets (acknowledging that the teams will have recently revised these objectives. For new objectives we are therefore looking for comment on their potential); 

To enable each country programme to surface lessons (eg about their newly revised Theories of Change and processes) and plan improvements;

To consider the ASPOL Governance structures and consider the suitability of this set up and provide recommendations on how to improve it; 

To evaluate the role of ASPOL in the wider Climate Solutions Partnership and to recommend ways in which ASPOL can be better integrated to the Partnership objectives, including the achievement of its KPIs; 

Assess whether we are set up for success: this includes analysis of strategies adopted, teams and resources deployed, internal ways of working; 

Based on the analysis above, support teams to provide solutions and clear ways forward (or provide recommendations directly); 

To run a portfolio wide workshop to validate the rearticulation of the Theories of Change, and discuss the recommendations from the evaluation outputs; 

To deliver an MTR report clearly documenting findings and recommendations on an agreed set of items, with an executive summary for sharing with the CSP governance body.

Each year the FRC assesses a sample of FTSE350 annual reports to examine the quality of reporting against the UK Corporate Governance Code. An important element of the assessment is the extent to which companies comply with the provisions of the Corporate Governance Code, and where they do not, the quality of their explanations. 

The 'comply or explain' nature of the Corporate Governance Code allows companies to adjust their approach to governance as appropriate for their business model and individual circumstances. Therefore, in some cases, non-compliance or partial compliance with the Corporate Governance Code is the right approach for a company.

The FRC is also responsible for the UK Stewardship Code which sets out the Principles of good investment stewardship. Investors are asked to disclose which third parties they use to support their stewardship activities, the services provided and how they are monitored and held to account. In particular, the Stewardship Code requires signatories to state the extent to which they use the default recommendations of proxy advisors.  

The aim of this research project is to examine how investors' stewardship and behaviour is affected by those recommendations and ratings. This includes understanding where, and in what circumstances, engagement takes place among companies, investors, and proxy advisors/ESG ratings agencies.

PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 
The objective of this research project is to answer several questions: 
  
A.	What are the impacts of recommendations/ratings given by proxy voting/ESG ratings agencies on FTSE350 companies' behaviour and reporting, and investor voting decisions? This should include the impact on governance policies and practices, and on so-called ""tick box"" behaviour. 
B.	What have been the processes and outcomes of engagement over the last two years among FTSE350 companies, investors, and proxy voting/ESG ratings agencies? We are particularly interested in three types of bilateral engagement: 
i.	Between FTSE350 companies and proxy voting/ESG ratings agencies on recommendations/ratings given by the latter. 
ii.	Between investors and proxy voting/ESG ratings agencies on recommendations/ratings given by the latter. 
iii.	Between investors and FTSE350 companies on recommendations/ratings given by proxy voting/ESG ratings agencies. 
In answering this question, we would also like the appointed research team to quantify the frequency of such engagements over the last two years. 
C.	What are the barriers to effective engagement between the parties as set out above? 
The purpose of this research project is to inform future policy work by the FRC or other agencies.

      The need is for places for pupils with autistic spectrum conditions (ASC), speech, language and communication needs (SLCN) and severe learning difficulties (SLD). 
      
      To address these needs, the council is conducting a procurement exercise to find an academy trust to open and run a new special free school providing up to 250 places from September 2024.  To comply with section 6A of the Education and Inspections Act, 2006 (the 'free school presumption') the council must, in the first instance, seek proposals to establish a free school from appropriately skilled, experienced and successful academy trusts.
      
      Under the free school 'presumption' route, West Northamptonshire council is responsible for funding the proposed new school and providing a suitable site.  WNC has identified land on St. John's Road, Tiffield. This is near Towcester.
      
      Capital totalling about ?15.5m is available to support the creation of 500 new specialist places between 2022 and 2024, with the other 250 places being provided through new and expanded resourced places in mainstream school and expansions of existing special schools.  The council will consider any additional capital funding required through its capital planning process.
      
      There are many steps to take before the proposed new school could open including further periods of consultation once a sponsor has been selected.  However, the key milestones are as follows:

Health Education England runs the Talent for Care national strategic framework.  From raising awareness of careers in health for young people and those wishing to join the NHS workforce, to supporting individuals to develop in their long-term career including with relevant qualifications, Talent for Care provides a framework for staff at all levels while also retaining a particular emphasis on improving opportunities for the support workforce.

With a focus on diversity, inclusion and widening participation from disadvantaged or underrepresented groups, Talent for Care supports employers with their workforce supply through programmes such as schools engagement, volunteering, work experience, pre-employment activity, apprenticeships and access to higher education and the registered professions.

The commissioning of this programme will support our current Widening Participation strategy 'It Matters' and support a workforce that is representative of the communities it serves, where progression and opportunities are based on merit, not social background, and equal employment opportunities are accessible for all.   
The strategy sets out five key goals, to: 
1.	improve monitoring and reporting of widening participation activities 
2.	enhance further the visibility and targeting of health careers information and advice 
3.	increase, through research and evaluation, the understanding and evidence of what and what does not work in relation to widening participation developments in healthcare education and workforce development 
4.	increase collaborative approaches in supporting widening participation initiatives, including outreach activity 
5.	stimulate and increase the capacity of healthcare organisations in being able to expand and support work or work-related experience opportunities 


In 2019 ten trusts (Cohort One) were funded to develop, deliver and evaluate SIW programmes, over a one year period (which was extended due to the impact of Covid), Cohort One are now running in to their second year of delivery.

This is a continuation of work following the success of SIW Cohort One, which engaged with over 400 adults in 2020 - 2021 . As a result, the programme has now also been extended to run over three years, to develop infrastructure, collect data and evidence and refine the programme delivery.  Health Education England now wishes to extend the programme to support access for a wider reach of adults in receipt of work-related benefits and is therefore issuing this invitation to submit a quotation.

The Fisheries Act (2020) places an obligation on Defra and the devolved administrations to prepare and publish Fisheries Management Plans (FMPs) to help achieve Defra's ambition for sustainable fisheries. The Act describes an FMP as a document that sets out policies designed to restore one or more stocks of sea fish to, or maintain them at, sustainable levels.
Once a FMP is published, the Act places a duty on national fisheries authorities to exercise their functions in accordance with the policies set out in FMPs. The plans therefore place binding obligations onto the national fisheries authorities to seek to deliver the goals of each FMP.
Each FMP will be reviewed at least every six years to ensure that they remain effective, although fisheries policy authorities can carry out more frequent and regular reviews on policies within the plans when considered appropriate. 
The draft Joint Fisheries Statement (JFS) included a list of proposed FMPs with a timetable for their publication. Defra are reviewing the responses to the JFS consultation, and a final list will be published by November 2022.
There are currently 43 planned FMPs:
-	21 are joint UK FMPs which will be jointly developed by all 4 UK administrations, with Scottish Government coordinating their preparation.  
-	2 FMPs coordinated by Northern Ireland published jointly with Welsh Government and Defra.  
-	Defra will be publishing 16 FMPs. 
FMPs will be a tool to implement wider policies and work on fisheries management, for example informing Defra's approach when negotiating the management of stocks shared with other coastal states.  
Defra led FMPs
Defra are leading on 16 FMPs, 12 of which focus on English waters with 4 being English and Welsh waters. The first 6 of these FMPs, known as 'frontrunners', will explore ways of preparing plans to build a shared understanding of everyone's roles in learning to work in collaboration in fisheries management.",Opportunity,Open,"2 August 2022, 12pm",SW1P 3JR,£0,20 June 2022,

The Greater Manchester Strategy recognises that the pandemic has disproportionately impacted our people and places, acknowledges that recovery will be tough. In Greater Manchester, we will make every effort to ensure that all our people are supported to live a good life, through all ages and stages in their lives. This includes a commitment to supporting our children and young people to be good learners, with any necessary family help, education recovery, wrap-around provision and health and wellbeing needs being met.

The Inequalities Commission and Build Back Fairer reports both emphasised the need for Greater Manchester to embed a preventative and 'future generations' approach. We need to ensure that Greater Manchester is meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

The GMCA is committed to prioritising work with children and young people, to share expertise and evidence of the success of prevention approaches and continue to build capacity and partnerships to further develop these approaches.

In June 2021, the VRU in partnership with the Innovation Hub held a Primary School Summit, to address growing anecdotal concerns from primary schools in GM that issues of intergenerational violence and knife carrying appeared to be increasingly prevalent and were affecting children at a younger age than had previously been the case.

Of those attendees working in schools 83% indicated that behaviour, particularly in respect to violence or threats of violence, had become worse. Furthermore, when the question was pitched in the context of communities, 90% felt that criminality involving violence, or the threat of violence had become worse.

A recommendation which arose from the Summit, was the recognition of the need to support effective transition between school phases and mentor schemes and ensure support is sustained as children transition to secondary school, drawing on existing good practice",Opportunity,Open,"18 July 2022, 12pm",England,"£300,000",17 June 2022,

This potential contract would be for the provision of Project Management & Cost Control (PMCC) services and would be a fundamental, strategic contract to support the delivery of a UKP at Expo 2025. 

The attached Provisional Specification of Requirements lists the potential PMCC services a supplier may need to provide for the successful delivery of a UKP.

The successful supplier would need to evidence that they have a direct presence in Japan or a partnership with an existing company in the country if they themselves are not fully based there. They would need to be able to operate in Japan for the length of the project and have experience of doing so previously. 

At this stage of early project development, HMG has not yet confirmed the scale of ambition of the pavilion to be installed at Expo 2025 Osaka, however a small or medium self-build (Type A) is likely, with a content-led focus. HMG is keen to understand the implications on its procurement of contracts and the contracts themselves for any of the options presented, and what having content and visitor experience at the centre of a UKP would mean for PMCC, Design, Construction and relevant contracts. 

Through this Early Engagement, the Department for International Trade (DIT), acting on behalf of HMG, is looking to engage with suppliers in the market that may eventually, if a procurement is run, consider bidding to deliver this contract. DIT wants to understand: How a PMCC contractor would look to operate in Japan; how DIT should look to structure its contracts in respect of the Japanese Market; aligning content design with building design and construction; market capability to operate in Japan; market capacity in Japan; procurement sequencing and timescales; deliverability in respect of timescales; and costs.

If you are interested in this potential opportunity, and, if a procurement for this requirement is eventually run, your organisation would consider bidding, DIT would like to engage with you and discuss. To do this, please follow the steps described below: 

Step 1: Please complete the questionnaire attached to this Early Engagement Notice (EEN) and submit it to the email stated in the ""Contact Details"" section of the EEN. The deadline to submit your Expression of Interest (EOI) and completed questionnaire is: 12:00 BST on 08/07/2022.

Step 2: Following the submission deadline, DIT will review submissions and may then arrange a meeting to discuss your thoughts and opinions on this potential requirement. The meetings will most likely be held w/c 18 or 25/07/2022, however this is subject to change. 

DIT will use the information gathered to help HMG further refine its approach and thinking before commencing formal procurement.",Early engagement,Open,8 July 2022,Any region,,17 June 2022,

from 1st November 2022

The Contract for both Lots that make up this procurement (Arlesey Medical Centre and Shortstown Surgery) is the NHS General Medical Service (GMS); a contract which will be held in perpetuity by a practice (as a branch surgery with patient list for a General Medical Services contractor).

The Authority has taken a strategic decision not to re-procure GP contracts of around 10,000 weighted list size or below as stand-alone APMS contracts, to ensure robust and sustainable long-term delivery of services.

The Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) has a strong desire that the current premises are maintained within primary care ensuring adequate access, capacity, and resilience for general practice services.

The CCG has decided that the most appropriate way to achieve this aim is to advertise these practices as branches with patient lists, thus retaining the current premises with managed list dispersal to the successful bidder/s.

The annual value pertaining to each separate Lot based on 21/22 figures is the following:

• Arlesey (Lot 1) - £436,200
• Shortstown (Lot 2) - £361,976

these figures represent the Global Sum that is calculated based on weighted list size using the Carr Hill Formula.

Cefas are now coordinating a UK ODA research and development project that aims to develop a risk analysis tool that places hazard identification and control at the heart of sustainable food system design. For the first time, it will connect disparate food sectors on land and water to take a holistic view of the whole food system, moving to climate-resilient, safer, healthier, and more sustainable global nutrition.

The new tool will systematically map data to calculate the impact of complex hazards interacting with the whole food system to demonstrate how hazard control catalyses benefits in terms of yield, profit, trade and biodiversity protection in environments where food production occurs, to enable more climate-efficient food sectors. 

The project seeks to bring together methods focussed on food sector hazards with methods focussed on environmental and climate change assessment. The aim of this part of the project is to identify and appraise available environmental and climate change assessment methods for their suitability as components of the risk analysis tool.

The requirement is to undertake a comprehensive literature/information review and objective appraisal of available approaches for assessing environmental and climate impacts of human activities. 

The successful tenderer will be required to:

a)	Produce a search and appraisal methodology, to be agreed with the Cefas project team
b)	Produce an interim report listing the tools, methods and approaches identified from the review

In advance of the launch of the tender process, the University wishes to conduct a market consultation exercise with parties interested in participating in the tender.

The purpose of the market consultation exercise is to give the University an opportunity to consult with interested parties on various aspects of the proposed EISC, in advance of the notice and tender documents being issued.

The market consultation exercise is not a procurement or a call for competition and no tenders are sought at this stage.

It is currently anticipated that the tender process will be launched in Autumn 2022 with the publication of a notice on the Find a Tender Service.

The Opportunity:

The University's vision is to partner with a third party to create a fully embedded, self-contained, dedicated EISC on campus which provides pathway (feeder) programmes for international students progressing onto Manchester Metropolitan University degree courses.

This would support the University's ambition to significantly increase the number of international students enrolled at the University.

To achieve the vision, it is envisaged that the EISC will:
• be established in partnership with a private provider/partner;
• be managed by the University and the Partner;
• be physically embedded on the University's campus; and
• be established such that the EISC students will have appropriate rights and access to the University's facilities (e.g., library, laboratories, studios, classrooms and accommodation) as appropriate.

It is envisaged that the EISC will initially be based in either existing University facilities or in leased space close to the campus, with the intention that purpose-built facilities for the EISC will be constructed on campus after a few years of operation.

The purpose of this market consultation is to gauge the level of market interest in the Opportunity and to give the University an opportunity to engage with interested economic operators on various aspects of the proposed opportunity in advance of the tender process.

The Global Mine Action Programme 3 (GMAP3) began in April 2022, and is building on the success of its predecessor (the Global Mine Action Programme 2) in tackling the threat of landmines and other explosive remnants of war. It has a confirmed total budget allocation of up to £100M covering three financial years (2022/2023; 23/24; 24/25). It will lead to increased human security, and support towards development and peace in priority countries. It will do this through the clearance of landmines and other explosive remnants of war, explosive ordnance risk education for affected communities, and building the capacity of national authorities and operators.

The EME for GMAP3 will be a virtual event taking place at 2 pm BST on Thursday 28 July. It will focus on multi-year contracts that will commence from early 2023 and run to end March 2025, with a likely option to extend. The contracts will operate in up to 12 countries. The tender process will cover multiple opportunities. Suppliers may bid for one or more of the contracts on their own or in partnership with others. The current thinking is to tender four opportunities, composed as follows:
- Afghanistan
- Angola, Cambodia, Zimbabwe, Laos
- Iraq, Ukraine
- Ethiopia, Myanmar, Somalia, Yemen, South Sudan

There will be a separate contract for monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) services across GMAP3. The Supplier(s) for the country contracts will be required to work closely with the MEL provider to ensure GMAP3&apos;s impact is well understood, allowing for adjustments to enhance delivery and building the wider evidence base for mine action.

This EME event is an opportunity for prospective GMAP3 multi-year contract suppliers to understand current GMAP3 planning, to ask question, and to provide feedback on the draft Terms of Reference (ToR). FCDO is interested in understanding how the Terms of Reference could be strengthened to better deliver the outcomes listed above.
Prospective suppliers are invited to complete the survey via EME Registration Form (https://bit.ly/3mNScSX), which also can be used to send written questions to the FCDO. It will also be possible to ask questions at the event, however, receiving questions in advance will help FCDO to prepare the responses in advance.

The draft Terms of Reference for GMAP3 and other supporting documents will be broadcasted via FCDO Portal a minimum of one week prior to the early market engagement event.",Early engagement,Open,5 August 2022,Any region,,16 June 2022,

Teleradiology offers trusts an alternative to manage routine, urgent or specialist workload, and supports with the reduction of backlogs in care. 

Teleradiology is the transmission of patients' radiological images between different locations for the production of a primary report, expert second opinion or clinical review. Telepathology is the electronic transmission of pathological images, usually derived from microscopes, from one location to another, for the purpose of interpretation and diagnosis. The different locations can be within the same organisation or in different organisations, within the same country or across international boundaries.

Other areas of telemedicine are also now being explored, including but not limited to telepathology, telemicrobiology and teledermatology. The scope of this agreement will include these and other specialties of telemedicine to allow for expansion into new services during the term of the agreement, to help support the NHS with elective recovery. 

Radiology workflow management systems are designed to improve productivity and efficiency in radiology departments. As business intelligence systems they allow precise forecasting of reporting capacity, enabling optimisation of departmental rotas and highlight areas for strategic recruitment based on supply and demand. These systems can reduce the costs of outsourcing and support radiology departments to operate as efficiently as possible.

This is by ensuring that the workforce of today and tomorrow has the right numbers, skills, values and behaviours, at the right time and in the right place.    

Autism is highlighted in the NHS Long-Term Plan (LTP), as a priority of the future workforce and training of the workforce is required to deliver safe and effective services.

To assess the cost to Local Authorities (LAs) and the investment needed to divert Domestic Seating Soft Furnishings (DSSF) waste to incineration. This involves understanding the impact on LAs, as well as any wider costs and benefits. There are multiple options that are being considered, each of which will need to be modelled.

These will be explained further in the background section.

Anticipated outcomes of the project include:
1. Produce a model of each option outlining the NPVs over 10 years. The modelling should be independent to the work already completed by Defra, although Defra resource can be shared with the successful applicant. Defra's assumptions and costs can be used in the modelling, although this is not a requirement.
2. A written report meeting the objectives and requirements set out in the work packages below, which can be developed subject to regular discussions with Defra.

      The vision of the project is to create a social collaborative platform where Alumni and SME's can interact digitally, compiled through the use of open-source components to allow the publishing, sharing and editing of a variety of documents and content, such as but not limited to academic papers and reports. Alumni and SME's would also have the ability to communicate and build relationships between themselves, e.g. Alumni to Alumni, SME's to SME's or Alumni to SME's, via a variety of channels, for example either via a private chat function or by posting updates in the form of a community forum which can be archived for future reference. Service providers would then be able to use data and information collected within the platform, which can then be reported upon.
      
      The platform will need to include features around security, such as secure profiling and the acceptance of a code of conduct, research and ethic terms, general terms and conditions, data and intellectual property and data management and a privacy policy document prior to registration and use of the platform.

Whilst also having the ability to develop the project into a commercial vehicle, including the capacity to accept payment for a service in a secure and compliant manner e.g. in line with PCI compliance.

The AH platform will need be technically intuitive and dynamic, with the method of design and development conducted through the employment of the Newcastle Living Lab to facilitate a co-produced, hands-on, projection-oriented approach to specifying a socio-technical system.

• Achieving the activity targets and timeframes both set in the service specification and developed and agreed in partnership with the provider.
• Enhancing the quality of life and improving the emotional wellbeing and mental health of the UASC, creatively utilising evidence-based interventions (support and therapy) delivered by suitably qualified and supervised professionals.

•	Accommodation based services are provided in psychologically informed accommodation, which has been designed to promote recovery and independence. 
•	Accommodation is designed around Residents needs, allowing them to live more independently with lower care requirements.   
•	Accommodation is built to high accessibility standards so appropriate additional adaptations are easy and affordable to install.
•	Residents in supported housing have the most secure form of tenancy compatible with the purpose of the housing and the client's needs and circumstances.
In addition to the above progressive standards, the minimum standards for accommodation include the following:
•	Accommodation meets all legal requirements
•	Comply with local council and statutory buildings regulations 
•	Comply with House in Multiple Occupation management duties and licensing standards
These minimum standards closely follow the Private Sector Housing Standards in the attached document Housing Support Approved Accommodation Standards. 
 
To enable us to meet the Council's ambitions, we are developing an accommodation list for building/s that have met the required accommodation standards, and those that have been approved by the Council for use. This list will be published on the Council's website and made available on the agreed digital platform to manage accommodation. 
The establishment of this Accommodation List is not a procurement process.

Without specialist intervention, many are unable to overcome barriers to recovery and employment. Individuals are often unwilling to disclose their dependency to Jobcentre Plus (JCP) work coaches due to denial, shame, or fear that they will be sanctioned in some way. Other individuals with a dependency may not be engaged with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) at all. As a result, individuals are not able to receive the help and support they need to overcome the addiction and move towards or into work. DWP is therefore seeking to run a new Peer Mentoring Trial, with the expectation of there being up to 18 Peer Mentors in 6 Jobcentre boroughs within England and Scotland in 2022-23 - North West and Central (5 Peer Mentors covering Liverpool City, Knowsley, Wirral, St Helens, Sefton); North East (4 Peer Mentors covering Kingston Upon Hull, North East Lincolnshire); London and Essex (3 Peer Mentors covering Hackney, Islington (Barnsbury, Finsbury Park), Tower Hamlets); South East (1 Peer Mentor covering Portsmouth - Portsmouth, Cosham); South West (2 Peer Mentors covering Bristol - Bristol Temple Street, Bishopsworth, Kingswood, Horfield); and Scotland (3 Peer Mentors covering Paisley, Patrick, Drumchapel). Peer Mentors will use their lived experience of addiction and recovery to inspire, motivate, and support others to manage their dependency, access appropriate support (including treatment, Universal Credit and housing services) and move towards employment. The expectation is that providers would be required to demonstrate a track record of engaging with drug and alcohol dependents and treatment services; recruit Peer Mentors with lived experience of drug or alcohol dependency;	suitably train Peer Mentors in supporting Mentees with complex needs and ensure they have a strong working knowledge and relationships with a range of support organisations in their local community; implement appropriate structures to manage, supervise and safeguard Peer Mentors and Mentees; confirm the potential Mentee's eligibility for any non-JCP referrals and obtain approval to Start from JCP; deliver the provision in a location which is accessible to customers from the dedicated Jobcentre offices; raise awareness of the Peer Mentoring Trial through new and existing relationships and networks; report timely, accurate and comprehensive management information as specified by the Authority; produce and report against an implementation plan; deliver provision in a flexible manner under any face-to-face restrictions, for example any pandemic related restrictions.

The Department for Education is seeking to engage a provider to deliver the third phase of the Early Years Professional Development Programme (PDP3). PDP3 will build on two earlier phases of the programme (PDP1 and PDP2).

The objective of PDP3, a Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programme, is to equip Early Years Practitioners (EYPs) with the skills they need to provide high quality support for early years children (age 2 - 4). This programme will have a particular emphasis on communication and language, maths, and Personal, social and emotional development (PSED). The overall aim is to ensure EYPs have the skills they need to support children to catch up when they are in settings and are able to refer them to the right services if required. The aim is at least 8,000 EYPs (with an optimum target of 10,000) trained by 31 March 2025.

The Department aims to cover all 152 Local Education Authorities nationally (England) under the PDP3 programme, with particular need to reaching Settings with high levels of disadvantaged children whose learning has been most affected by COVID-19.

History of PDP 1 and 2 for information only:

The first phase, &apos;PDP 1&apos;, was rolled out to 50 Local Authorities (LAs) in 2019. Training here focused on early language and mathematics and utilised a cascade model to train champions who then embedded their learning in settings. Training was initially delivered face to face, but was pivoted to online provision following the COVID-19 pandemic.

PDP was extended to 51 additional LAs across England in the 2021 to 2022 academic year under &apos;PDP 2&apos;. As well as early language and mathematics, PDP 2 included content on personal, social and emotional development (PSED) for 2 to 4-year-olds in direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that children&apos;s mental health and wellbeing is prioritised. The training also included a focus on staff wellbeing. PDP 2 was delivered online directly to practitioners, rather than using a cascade model. PDP 1 and 2 end in July 2022.

1412,Short Breaks Provision - Consultation,https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/notice/46533c45-0826-47fc-ab52-68222dcc5239?origin=SearchResults&p=71,Bath and North East Somerset Council,"Consultation about Activities for Children and Young people with Special Educational Needs and Disability
Bath and North East Somerset Council are reviewing the short breaks activities it currently delivers for children and young people with Special Educational Needs and/or Disability (SEND). The Council are aiming to consult with parent carers, providers and non-providers of short break provision as well as professionals delivering specialist services asking them to share their views on the current short break provision that is on offer. Children and young people will be asked to consult on short break provision at a later date in September.

What is a Short break?
A short break is where children and young people with disabilities and additional needs participate in activities that they enjoy in their leisure time (outside school hours) for example playing sport, spending time with friends, joining a club to spending a few days away from home. 

The purpose of this consultation
We typically review short breaks provision every 3 to 5 years. When we review activities and services delivered in leisure time (short breaks), we provide an opportunity for everyone to be involved in the decisions made about our commissioning intentions. We also look at what other local authorities are delivering in their areas that relate to short break provision.
COVID 19 highlighted a number of issues and gaps within the current service model of short breaks (activities and services delivered in leisure time). When the pandemic began in March 2020, short break provision had to close and it was uncertain when it would re-open. This put additional pressures on families of disabled children and those with additional  needs. Going forward, we would like to avoid this from happening again. 

When is the consultation taking place?
The consultation will run from 6th June 2022 until 15th July 2022. If you would like to have your say about the activities on offer for Children and young people with Special Educational Needs and/ or Disability (SEND) in B&NES please follow this link www.bathnes.gov.uk/shortbreaksconsultation",Early engagement,Open,15 July 2022,England,,10 June 2022,

Through the initial pilot year, the successful delivery partner, along with an external evaluator, will be required to combine these approaches into a 'mentoring' model. Mentors will work closely with individual pupils and their families supporting them and working to address any individual barriers to attendance they might face in conjunction with their school, local authority, and other relevant services.
The frequency and duration of the support provided will differ between each pupil depending on their specific circumstances. The successful delivery partner will need to test and refine the approach during this period before expanding to the full trial in years two and three with a more defined intervention and evaluation. After the first year, we will look to build evidence about the efficacy of the approach in different circumstances.

- Have improved overall attendance levels and engagement with education for all pupils who are participating.
- Developed our understanding of effective practice and different delivery models when delivering 1-1 support to pupils who are persistent or severely absent.

Detailed work as follows:
Work Schedule: - Silt Removal:
Silt in Pond - approx. 290 cube
• Cofferdams to be set up splitting the pond into 3 or 4 areas
• Inlets and outlet to be diverted where required
• Silt allowed to drain and then removed from Pond
• Silt to be stored and dried next to pond then taken away from site
• Disposal of silt as recommended by local authority (The Council may have a location to remove the silt too, via a local farmer and the Council's allotments, but this is not guaranteed).
Work Schedule - Walkway:
• The concrete walkway above the brick walls is no longer even, and provides a trip hazard for walkers.  It has been repaired with Tarmac in order to get the differing levels to ""meet"", but now requires re-setting to ensure an even walkway around the entire pond.
Work Schedule - Wall Damage:
• As the damage to the walls is only visual above the water line a further inspection would be required when each section is drained
• All existing brickwork to be jet washed for closer inspection
• Any failing brickwork to be replaced
• Any lose mortar to be replaced between brickwork
• The movement in the walls will make future guarantees limited on any works undertaken
Note:  The pond is not leaking, and the base of the pond is estimated to be a proportion of cement, and a proportion of clay (the surrounding area is made up of London Clay)
Work Schedule - Island:
• An inspection is required below water line of the brickwork
• Some copings to be re-laid or replaced as necessary
Work Schedule - Introduction of Aquatic Planting:
• It would be possible to introduce some planting zones, but these would be required to be separated from the fish
• Shallow marginals or floating planters could be introduced
• Plants provide a balanced aquatic eco-system and would help keep the phosphate levels lower
Work Schedule: Inlets and outlets
• The outlet could be modified to allow for greater collection of silt and floating debris, this could help alleviate any future flooding of the road

It is tasked with ending the viability of the small boats route as a means of entering the UK and with preventing other forms of high-risk clandestine entry. The overarching requirement is that the strategic RPAS service must be safe and lawful to operate in UK airspace from UK airfields.  As such, the people, platform, and wider system must have full regulatory approval to operate in the UK. This requirement will need to be delivered via a managed service that provides an enduring airframe operational capability. The requirement for RPAS platforms, rather than manned aircraft, is a product of both the known utility of these systems, and a parallel requirement to utilise the platform for future Operational Experimentation with partner agencies to explore the potential to expand these technologies into other operational domains.   
Aerial surveillance is required as part of a wider Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance package to support decision making and the tasking and coordination of operational assets; and to collect high-quality footage of criminality to support potential prosecutions. 
The minimum criteria for the managed service are:
1) Must meet all regulatory requirements (CAA, OFCOM, etc) and be capable of flying beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS);
2) Must be capable of reliably detecting, identifying, and classifying a broad range of targets during day and night operations, in varying weather conditions, over a wide area, in the maritime environment. This includes the detection of people, vehicles, and vessels;
3) Must be fitted with detect and avoid capability acceptable to CAA to facilitate operations in unsegregated airspace where necessary. 
4) Must have the ability to record high-quality full motion video (FMV) to support criminal justice proceedings;
5) Must have the ability to move rapidly between tracks of interest (>90kmh);
6) A live FMV downlink to the multiple locations;
7) A liaison officer to facilitate dynamic tasking;
8) Individual sorties should last at least 16 hours (take-off to landing), up to approximately 4000 hours per annum per task line.

Home Office requires a supplier who can provide this managed service to achieve the required capability within 4 months from the date of contract award which is anticipated in Q4 2022 with a total anticipated contract duration of 24 months. Suppliers who can offer a solution and provide the required services are requested to register their interest directly with the Buyer named below and to register as supplier on the RM6235 Space-Enabled and Geospatial Services (link provided below).

PCH are seeking to engage with suitably experienced Contractors and flue specialists to design, replace and lower the existing SE duct terminals to 3nr fifteen-storey apartment Towers in Plymouth.

Works to the SE ducts are programmed to commence in summer 2022 and should be complete before September 2022 to avoid the requirement for temporary heating.

The 'SE ducts' are a communal gas flue system commonly used around the mid-20th Century. Each of the Towers benefit from four SE ducts; two larger SE ducts serve gas-fired warm air heaters from 30nr apartments with two smaller ducts serving 15nr apartments each (90nr apartments in total per Tower). Each SE duct is topped with a terminal. 

The works comprise coordinating design of replacement SE duct terminals, isolation and capping of gas services/appliances to each apartment (phased per duct/Tower), road closures and crane lifting replacement terminals to roof level, demolition of existing concrete ducts and supporting structure, formation of new waterproofing upstands, supply and installation of new SE duct terminals, isolated flat roof works around each cowl and recommissioning of gas connection/appliances (full purge) through each Tower. This is together with all associated temporary works and any other works clearly apparent as being necessary for the safe and proper completion of the works. In addition, isolated corrosion treatment is required to roof parapet structures. 

Qualified gas operatives will be required to apply and obtain 'approved contractor status' from the PCH gas team prior to being able to work on any gas appliances. A working knowledge and justifiable experience of working on Johnson Starley warm air heaters is essential given that this is the predominant form of heating throughout the apartments. 

The Main Contractor will be responsible for undertaking the Resident Liaison Officer role to gain access to each apartment to undertake the gas isolation/recommissioning work and Principal Contractor duties under the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015.

Caribbean nurses arrived in Britain, alongside other skilled and unskilled workers on HMT Empire Windrush in June 1948, the same year as the inception of the NHS. ""Windrush nurses were, and their descendants remain, major contributors to the NHS workforce"". This programme was originally developed to mark the 70th anniversary of the arrival of the Windrush.

Staff are the greatest resource the NHS has and one in five are of Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic (BAME) origin rising to much higher levels in some parts of the country. It is evidenced through the WRES data that our BAME staff are treated less favourably, have poorer working experience and progression opportunities. 

Organisations with diverse workforce and leadership are more likely to be sensitive to local health needs, including those linked to reducing health inequalities linked to ethnicity. 

This programme aims to develop the leadership potential in BAME nurses and midwives and provides them with the opportunity to realise their potential. 

Windrush Leadership Scholarships 
 
These scholarships provide an opportunity for up to 5 BAME nurses and or midwives to further develop their leadership potential through a peer-to-peer learning environment to discover and explore personal leadership styles.

Health Education England's (HEE) National Volunteering Unit (NVU) is part of the Directorate of Talent for Care and Nursing and Midwifery and aims to support volunteering across health and care through the design, development and promotion of education, training and development of resources and opportunities. The NVU encourages staff who want to volunteer within the NHS, by providing unique and accessible projects and programmes to do so, and harnesses and embraces the power of the new technology and digital to drive work forward.

The NVU was established in 2020 following the heightened awareness of volunteering in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and recognition of the opportunities and benefits of volunteering in terms of supporting patient care, the NHS and wider voluntary, community, and social enterprise sector. The instrumental role volunteers have in the prevention of ill-health and positive affect on wellbeing and personal development (their own, that of the patients and staff they support, and their communities) has therefore been recognised, as well as the benefits to volunteers themselves.
Helpforce was established in 2017 and partners with health and care organisations across the UK to accelerate the growth and impact of volunteering. Helpforce are an independent not-for-profit innovator, focused on co-creation with NHS trusts and systems, and rapidly sharing insights and best practice. HEE has been working in partnership with Helpforce since 2018.

HEE believe that Helpforce is the only supplier who can support the Volunteer to Career programme, co-ordinate, manage and oversee the three phases (outlined in the PIN documentation on the portal), and support the requirements to complete the programme during 2022/23 with their knowledge, expertise and experience of the Volunteer to Career programme.

Westminster City Council and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea will be embarking on re-commissioning Adult Social Care Learning Disabilities Housing Care and Support contracts, introducing a structured procurement process under the Housing Care and Support Framework, formalising the sourcing and placement process which supports an efficient commissioning and delivery model. 
Person-centred care is a key theme running through this vision. Genuine choice and control about personalised care and support can enhance quality of life and promote independence in a way that matters to individuals. Together, these measures aim to put learning disabilities service users at the heart of what we do.  We seek to ensure co-production with providers is embedded through the commissioning and procurement processes in the development and implementation of the framework with a co-ordinated long-term vision in-line with responsibilities set under the care act 2014 to ensure personalisation, independence, choice, control and designing services to local demand.

The market engagement event will provide an opportunity to discuss the borough's vision for how learning disabilities housing care and support is to be delivered in the future. We are keen to hear your views and utilise your expertise to commission a high quality and sustainable service for our residents.

Providers with experience of delivering these types of services in-borough and neighbouring boroughs are invited to attend a supplier engagement event on Friday 29th July 2022 (am).  Full details of venue location and time will be  issued  via the capitalesourcing portal.

Kindly  register your expression of interest via our e-tendering portal; www.capitalesourcing.com and search for the following reference: pqq_WCC_1788_Learning Disabilities, Housing Care and Support Framework.
A market sounding questionnaire will be made available on the portal inviting feedback from providers in the market to outline their level of interest and capacity in relation to this future opportunity.

It achieves this through a focus on the three pillars of the DfT Science Plan: people, partnerships and purpose.

As part of a ScITech's programme to broaden access to expertise across DfT to support policy making and delivery, as well as to help grow and support the academic transport community, we are establishing a programme of postgraduate internships and PhD studentships. These will provide:  

Interns: to conduct short, independent research projects of between 3-6 months on key areas of departmental priority 

PhDs: programmes of focused study on areas of particular need within DfT or in a specific area where DfT is keen to grow capability.   

These two routes to work with early-stage academic researchers will provide DfT with access to a wide pool of academic expertise and support the development of the talent pipeline for DfT and the wider transport Research & Development sector. 

The aim is for this work to benefit both DfT and the academic student and their institution.  DfT will have access to expertise and talent not otherwise available, and work on topics that might not otherwise be taken forward. The student in return gains an insight into how government works, how policy is developed and implemented and the types of evidence and research needed. They will experience working life for civil servants, including communicating to senior policy officials for impact and working at pace. 

The Authority seeks to develop, manage and deliver the process on the department&apos;s behalf.

Intermediate care is a short-term intervention to preserve the independence of people who might otherwise face unnecessarily prolonged hospital stays or inappropriate admission to hospital or residential care.

Bed-based intermediate care aims to prevent unnecessary admissions to acute hospitals and premature admissions to long-term care, and to support timely discharge from hospital. For most people, interventions last up to 6 weeks.

Therapy input will be delivered by the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust (LGT) Therapy Team with programmes supported by the care home / provider staff.

• the draft service specification

• timescales for procurement and mobilisation of the new contract

• proposed contract duration and financial model

A draft service specification and financial model are available for download via the tender portal.

The service specification, contract values and contract duration stipulated are all in draft and are being developed at the time of publication of this MEQ. Feedback from this MEQ exercise will be considered by the commissioners before the service specification and other contract parameters are finalised for the next stage of the process.

We are looking for a supplier with experience of running large social campaigns that focus on positively influencing consumer attitudes.
We Eat Balanced is AHDB's flagship consumer marketing campaign, launched as a pilot in January 2021. The We Eat Balanced social media channels were initially launched to host advertising content for this pilot, but due to the successful results, 'always on' social media activity has since been activated, as well as further large TV-led advertising campaign bursts.
AHDB does have an in-house social media team, however they currently do not have enough capacity to support this workstream in full, hence it has so far been outsourced, but it may be brought back in-house in future.
Note: although this brief focuses on We Eat Balanced, there's potential for AHDB to also need support for its other social media channels in future.

The first contract is the most significant and will involve 1) designing, carrying out and reporting on a programme of primary data collection, 2) carrying out research to understand the drivers of waste composition and, based on this, developing a model for updating data in years where primary data collection is not carried out and 3) conduct research to review and recommend near-market approaches to measuring the composition of waste that might make routine waste composition analysis more affordable in the future. The second contract is for a quality assurance auditor for item 1) of the first contract. 
The outputs from the project will be used to inform policy development and evaluation and will deliver important evidence on which to base waste and resources actions to achieve Defra's contribution to net zero ambitions. They will:
1.	Play a crucial role in determining levels of fees and payments in packaging EPR by generating a new estimate of the amounts of different types and formats of packaging being managed by local authorities in mixed residual waste
2.	Inform policy work on implementing a Deposit Return Scheme in England, by providing more granular data on in-scope drinks packaging found in residual waste
3.	Inform policy thinking on how to tackle garden waste going to landfill in a context where local authorities are increasingly charging for its collection. In landfill, it may degrade and emit methane.
4.	Inform our work to reform WEEE and batteries producer responsibility and to introduce EPR for textiles, by providing evidence on the extent to which these items are disposed of rather than recycled.

The procurement is divided into two Lots. Suppliers may bid for one or both Lots. Lot 1 will be evaluated first. The successful supplier for Lot 1 will not be eligible for Lot 2, so if they have bid their proposal will be rejected at this stage.

The two crossings are operated, maintained and improved by the Tamar Bridge and Torpoint Ferry Joint Committee (also known as Tamar Crossings) on behalf of the parent authorities.

The Tamar Bridge forms a vital road link on the A38 across the river Tamar estuary connecting the town of Saltash in Cornwall and the city of Plymouth in Devon.

The Torpoint Ferries cross the lower reaches of the river Tamar (also known as the Hamoaze) between Torpoint in Cornwall and Devonport in Plymouth.

The Tamar bridge was opened in 1961 and at the time of opening was the longest suspension bridge in the UK.  It is a conventional suspension bridge with a total length of 642m, a main span of 335m and each side span is 114m.  The stiffening truss is approximately 5.5m deep.  The road deck level is approximately 35m above the River Tamar.  Each main tower and side tower is constructed from concrete.  The main towers are approximately 76m tall. 

On average the bridge carries 45,000 vehicles daily.

The bridge was strengthened and widened between 1999 and 2001 increasing the capacity of the bridge from 3 traffic lanes to 4 traffic lanes and adding a dedicated pedestrian and cycle path.

Tamar Crossings employ a small in house engineering team that manage bridge inspections, maintenance works and engineering projects.  Bridge inspections are undertaken in accordance with the Department for Transport and National Highways Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) CS450 , industry best practice, and regimes developed specifically by the overseeing organisation for the Tamar Bridge.

The joint authorities seek to appoint an experienced consultant with a demonstrable background in the design, maintenance and improvement of cable supported bridge structures, particularly suspension bridges.  The experienced consultant will be required to support the in house engineering team and undertake annual bridge inspections and undertake other special inspection activities as required/necessary.  The joint authorities also require the appointed consultant to provide design and other technical expertise and support related to the ongoing operation and maintenance of the bridge.  This could include the preparation of works information, specifications, preparation of tender documentation, providing impartial evaluation of tendered bids and providing ongoing contract management support, as may be necessary, in relation to key maintenance contracts.

The appointed consultant will be required to act as Principal Designer under the Construction Design and Management Regulations 2015.

The NCCE 2 programme aims to improve the quality of computing teaching for primary and secondary state-maintained schools and colleges in England. This will be delivered through a network of computing hubs providing continuous professional development (CPD) for teachers, events for teachers and pupils, delivery of digital products including GCSE and A level online platforms and teacher resources, school engagement, stakeholder and sector expertise and a programme management office to ensure that the NCCE 2 provides a clear and joined up computing education offer for schools, teachers and pupils. 

The programme delivery compromises a package of interrelated functions. The overall programme will be delivered via a contract and the contract will include the administration and management of grants to support the hub network and a grant claims service.  The funding values associated with the grant elements are not included in the overall contract value, as the grant elements will require funding drawn down from DfE. This is further explained in the Invitation to Tender documentation.

The overall programme delivery is through a contract, which will include:

1.	Mobilisation and set up of NCCE 2
2.	Programme management and co-ordination to ensure a seamless experience for teachers, schools and pupils
3.	Grant administration of an existing network of computing hub schools and colleges and their satellites 
4.	Delivery and support of CPD to teachers in state-maintained schools and events for teachers and pupils
5.	Delivery of digital products and resources, including online platforms for GCSE and A level Computer Science and teacher resources
6.   Stakeholder expertise and engagement to enhance the experience of computing education in schools in England
7.   Providing subject matter expertise and industry outreach (representing the NCCE 2 programme and feedback to the DfE)
8.	Social value 

The DfE undertook market engagement activity in September and October 2021 for interested organisations to learn more about its delivery objectives and to provide insight into the new programme. The DfE will be seeking bid proposals from individual organisations or consortia to deliver this programme. 

The contract start date will be 4th November 2022 to allow for the set up and mobilisation period, and the handover of the existing programme from the NCCE 1 supplier including transfer of assets and knowledge. This will require working collaboratively with the incumbent supplier whose contract will end on 31st March 2023. The set up and mobilisation period for NCCE 2 will end on 31st March 2023.

However, it will be beneficial for bidders to have good working knowledge of some of the areas listed below. The reform programme areas that you will be expected to work on are, but not limited to:

Apprenticeships:
Following the Richard Review, reforms to the Apprenticeship programme have moved Apprenticeships from frameworks to standards. The introduction of Occupational maps, with clearly identified technical routes, form a central part of the Department's reforms to all post-16 technical education.

Higher Technical Qualifications (HTQs):
Following the 2020 Higher Technical Education Reform consultation, a new, opt-in, HTQs approvals process has been launched, led by the Institute. The aim is to address the low uptake of high-quality qualifications at levels 4 and 5 and to better meet employer needs.

Post-16 Qualifications Review:
Following the direction from the Wolf Review; the Sainsbury Panel's report, and the removal of qualifications from performance tables, the government introduced an ambitious plan to ensure that the Post-16 qualifications landscape is fit for purpose. This includes a review of ESOL qualifications at level 2 below and English and maths and digital ""steppingstone"" qualifications at level 1 and below.

T Levels:
In the reforms outlined in the Post-16 Skills plan, the Government accepted all the recommendations of Lord Sainsbury's report on Technical Education. Subsequently, a programme to develop new T Levels was launched, phased over four years, with the first courses introduced in September 2020.

which includes programmes of peat restoration and tree planting. As part of this, Natural 
England is delivering a competitive grant scheme; the Nature for Climate Peatland Grant 
Scheme (NCPGS). The NCPGS will contribute to bringing landscape scale restorative 
action to degraded upland and lowland peatlands across England over four years, from 
2021 to 2025. 
There are two key targets for the NCPGS, which are linked directly to the delivery of the 
England Peat Action Plan. They are to: 
- undertake restorative action on 35,000 ha of degraded peat in England by March 2025, putting the sites on a trajectory to recovery 
- reduce emissions from peat by 9 Mt CO2e cumulatively by 2050 

Through the NCPGS, the government intends to invest over £50 million in peat restoration by 2025. There are two separate grants in the NCPGS:
- Restoration Grants
- Discovery Grants

Restoration Grants fund capital works to restore peatland on a landscape scale. They can fund up to 75% of costs, and in exceptional cases up to 85%. The window for applications to the 2022 Restoration Grant is due to open in April and will run for 8 weeks.

You can find out more about the Restoration Grant in the &apos;NCPGS Restoration Grant Guide for Applicants&apos;, a copy of which is provided as an Annex of the Discovery Grant Invitation to Apply (ITA) pack. Final details of the 2023 Restoration Grant will be confirmed prior to the 2023 application window.

Discovery Grants fund work to unlock barriers to peatland restoration and prepare projects to apply for Restoration Grants in future rounds. It is expected that if you receive a Discovery Grant, you will bid into the final Restoration Grant round in 2023. Discovery Grants can cover up to 100% of costs.

Peatland restoration includes works to raise the water table or reinstate peat-forming vegetation. Barriers to restoration may be from any aspect of a project, such as:

We will therefore be seeking to procure new contracts to deliver education services in prisons across England.

Our vision is that everyone of working age and able to work should leave prison prepared for employment or further education and training. The new service will therefore expand the scope of 'prison education', bringing together areas of learning, skills and work into one transformative service. This will facilitate better outcomes for prisoners on release and ultimately contribute to reducing reoffending.

To achieve this vision, we are seeking to procure new education contracts by engaging with a diverse range of providers and suppliers that can offer prisoners a range of learning opportunities.

In order to achieve this Dorset Council's Adults and Housing Directorate is opening a new Framework; this will act as a vehicle to procure a range of care and support, housing and community safety services. It will replace the existing Frameworks.
The Dorset Care, Support, Housing and Community Safety Framework will be established by utilising the flexibilities of the Light Touch Regime under the Public Contract Regulations 2015. These enable Public Sector Bodies, in terms of health and social care, to adapt and innovate procurement and contracting models to best meet service requirements. 
The Framework will be in place for up to 10 years and will enable providers to join at any time (as long as specific criteria is met) instead of fixed opening periods (as is the case with the existing Frameworks). It will work in two stages as follows:
•	Part I: The overarching 10 year framework will open and detail specific lots. At this stage providers need to meet the minimum entry criteria, this is detailed when the framework is open. At this stage providers will be asked to complete minimum entry criteria for the Lots they may in future wish to participate in further competitions for. 
•	In Part 2 providers will be invited further competition which will include further quality / price evaluation processes in respect of  ""specific call off""s. It is anticipated that this process will commence from April 2022.
The Framework shall allow a variety of procurement methods in order to support flexibility; opportunities to expand Providers' geographical reaches and to respond to the needs of Service Users in receipt of Direct Payments or Personal Health Budgets. These shall include but are not limited to: 

•	Brokerage of individual packages 
•	Fixed term block contracts 
•	Individual Service Funds (ISF)

SCCL will use the Pre- Market Engagement sessions to outline the future strategic objectives for the NHS Supply Chain, share the key requirements of the Logistics Services Provider contract, and for SCCL to capture industry information and Potential Provider views that may assist in the development of the NHS Supply Chain's Logistics Operating Model.

SCCL aims to commence procurement in late summer 2022 for the provision of Logistics services. These services are critical for the delivery of NHS Supply Chain goods procured under the CTSP frameworks which are available to 1) any NHS Trust; 2) any other NHS entity or healthcare provider (including private organisations, primary care, community settings and social care); 3) any government department, agency, or other statutory body (including Devolved Authorities, Crown Dependencies and/or Pandemic Planning Programmes), and/or 4) any private sector entity active in the UK healthcare sector on behalf of a public-sector organisation listed in 1) to 4) above.

NHS Supply Chain manage the sourcing, delivery and supply of healthcare products, services and food for NHS trusts and healthcare organisations across England and Wales. In 2018, SCCL (the management function of the NHS Supply Chain) entered contracts with 11 Category Tower Service Providers (CTSPs) to provide goods and services to NHS trusts and healthcare organisations across England and Wales. Goods are delivered through two enabling services which underpin the CTSP model, these enabling services are Logistics and Fulfilment, and Supporting Technology.

The scope of the current contract involves the operational logistics management of the NHS Supply Chain estate, Home Delivery Services (HDS), additional in-bound logistics and inter-depot trunking services.

NHS Supply Chain currently manages more than 8 million orders per year, across 94,000 order points and 17,465 locations and delivers over 28 million lines of picked goods to the NHS annually. Its systems consolidate orders from over 930 suppliers, saving trusts time and money by removing duplication of overlapping contracts.

The above scope may be further extended to incorporate the provision of pandemic response logistics, this may include the storage and fulfilment of legacy Covid 19 related consumables and equipment.

SCCL would like to meet with Potential Providers who are advised to register on the jaggaer  system under Project 979 at https://nhssupplychain.app.jaggaer.com/  for further important information about the Market Engagement Sessions  pre-market engagement questionnaire.

Innovate UK is establishing a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) as a means of awarding contracts for monitoring services.

Innovate UK provides grant funding to individuals and organisations involved in developing technology and science innovations. It is vital for Innovate UK that the performance and progress of publicly funded projects are monitored to ensure that the funding is used properly and effectively.

The DPS is divided into a 48 Lots based on the different areas of innovation to which the innovation projects relate. 

The DPS is a completely electronic tendering system through which Monitoring Services Providers (MSPs) can apply to be admitted to a specific Lot. Interested parties must specify which Lots they are applying to join. Admission to a Lot or Lots is no guarantee of work, but Innovate UK's intention would be to invite tenders from MSPs within Lots for future Monitoring Services opportunities.

About Innovate UK and UKRI.

Innovate UK is the UK's innovation agency. We are
an executive non-departmental public body sponsored
by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial
Strategy (BEIS) and are incorporated as the
Technology Strategy Board by Royal Charter in
England and Wales.
In April 2018 changes will be made to the structure of
the UK's research and innovation bodies (including
Innovate UK). A new body corporate will be
established under the Higher Education and Research
Act 2017 that brings together the UK's seven
Research Councils, Innovate UK and a new
organisation, Research England. This new body will
be known as UK Research and Innovation (""UKRI"").
With the establishment of UKRI, Innovate UK
(Technology Strategy Board) will cease to exist as a
body corporate in its own right and will become a
committee or 'Council' of UKRI. Innovate UK will
continue to administer contract and grant funding and
to manage the relationship with MSPs as a Council of
UKRI. However, existing contracts awarded by
Innovate UK under the DPS will be transferred to
UKRI under a statutory transfer scheme and future
contracts awarded under the DPS will be entered into
by UKRI. More information about UKRI is available

Make Happen is the working name of the current Uni Connect Partnership, formerly known as the National Collaborative Outreach Programme partnership for Essex, 
As it stands, the Uni Connect Programme brings together 29 partnerships of universities, colleges and other local partners to deliver outreach programmes to young people in years 9 to 13 and to adult learners who are aged 19 and above. Their work is focused on local areas where higher education participation is lower than might be expected given the GCSE results of the young people who live there. There may also be opportunities to deliver activity to students in year 7 and 8 through the Outreach Hub.  However, the Office for Students may decide to further expand the targeted groups, within all the sub categories, during the life of the Quasi-DPS.

Make Happen is looking for educational providers/suppliers who can support us with meeting the government's aims.

Phase three of Uni Connect aims to:  
* Contribute to reducing the gap in higher education participation between the most and least represented groups. 
* Equip young and adult learners from underrepresented groups to make an informed choice about their options in relation to the full range of routes into and through higher education and to minimise the barriers they may face when choosing the option that will unlock their potential. 
* Support a strategic local infrastructure of universities, colleges and other partners that can cut through competitive barriers, offer an efficient and low-burden route for schools and colleges to engage, and address outreach 'cold spots' for underrepresented groups. 
* Contribute to a stronger evidence base around 'what works' in higher education outreach and strengthen evaluation practice across the sector.

We are looking to find suppliers to deliver schools and/or FEI activity which support the goals above. The activity could focus on whole year groups, focused group activity or one to one activity.

Those providers approved to join the system can then be invited by local commissioners to bid to provide APMS services when local needs arise.

The PDPS is a 4-year procurement exercise managed through a new e-procurement platform and will see:

GP providers appointed to an electronically managed list of approved providers

 

GP providers can apply and be added to this list at any time during the 4-year period, unlike a traditional procurement framework,

 

once approved onto the PDPS, GP providers can be invited via the e-platform to respond to requests for APMS services from local commissioners. These local 'call-offs' will be matched to the bespoke needs of local commissioners.

 
To ensure the PDPS can be managed efficiently while also being sensitive to local commissioner (and provider) needs it will be broken down in to Lots

Lot 1 - Substantive APMS Contracts

Lot 2 - GP Caretaker Contracts

The PDPS will be further broken down into geographical sub-Lots (7 sub-Lots in line with the 7 NHSEI regional areas). GP Providers can apply to be an approved APMS and/or caretaker provider in one or more of the stated Lots and Sub-Lots.

Application on to the approved provider list does not commit providers to providing APMS services, nor does it guarantee a provider will be awarded a contract through the PDPS, but it does mean providers will be able to bid when local needs arise. Applications to join the PDPS will be managed in consecutive ""Rounds"". These Rounds have specific start and end dates by which applications must be submitted. If a provider misses the deadline to submit an application for a particular Round, they can submit their application for evaluation as part of the next Round.

There are real challenges in enabling social value to be applied effectively primarily because organisations have conflicting pressures on delivery, risk, scale and cost management which vary. 

Orbit is passionate about building communities and investing in our communities. It is hoped that the growth of social suppliers is increased by working with Orbit and similar organisations across the housing and wider public and other sectors. There is an increasing desire to buy from VCSE's and this desire is being driven by organisational ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) approaches, a generational shift in expectations along with the direction of travel of government led initiatives such as PPN's 0620 and 1120, the industrial and civil society strategies and the Social Value Act.

This is a re-tender of an existing framework; however we now intend to procure services by way of a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS), which will allow more flexibility and the potential for new Providers to join during the contract period.

Each individual contract will be subject to a Secondary Competition process and with new providers able to join the DPS at any point, this should enable us to secure a price for services that is competitive and reflective of the market at that time. In exceptional circumstances direct awards may be undertaken dependant on the needs of the young person.

There is the option for Nottingham City Council Nottinghamshire County Council and Derbyshire County Council to use the DPS for Secondary Competitions and Direct Awards. 

The DPS is scheduled to run until 31st March 2024. 

Applications are made in a series of rounds that open and close at the discretion of the Council. The latest round closed on 30th November 2020. 

The DPS is currently paused to further applications  to allow the Council sufficient time to  review likely requirements over the coming months, specifically the numbers of potential placements required, the needs of our children and young people and ensure quality of the current provision to deliver as broad a range of accommodation and support as possible. We hope to have completed this by Spring of 2021 and may re-open a new round for applications at that point.

UPDATE MARCH 2020
Update due to an IT upgrade taking place (23/03/2020 - 27/03/2020) for the DPS. The new pqq_28831 has replaced the previous pqq reference. There has been the addition of five new Service Lines. Please see updated attachments containing details of the Service Lines and how to apply, in Other Information.

As set out in the Green Paper 'Improving Lives: Work, Health and Disability' , published in October 2016, the department is looking to deliver a number of new proof of concept' (PoC) to improve the support that it can offer and to understand what best works.

This is a Contract Notice for social and specific services in accordance with Directive 2014/24/EU Article 24.  The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) intends to establish a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) to procure these activities in in England, Scotland and Wales.  The DPS is for the procurement of social and other services referred to in Regulation 74 of the Public Contracts Regulations (2015) and as such, the intention is to use a light touch regime, rather than the full regime described in Regulation 34 (Dynamic Purchasing System).

This DPS will present opportunities for organisation, with a focus on innovation and local specialist support, to be involved and test the development of new approaches for employment and health related activity.  This will be key to building evidence to support the delivery of future provision at both national and local level.

At this stage we cannot confirm or guarantee any future business through the DPS but it is anticipated that there will be some limited numbers of proof of concepts in specific parts of the country in the next 6-12 months.  However, it is expected that as the DPS develops the activity will increase involving most, if not all, parts of the country.

The T&L DPS will commence on the first date that DWP signs the first DPS Contract, expected to be in November 2018.  The T&L DPS will be open ended, but can be terminated by the Authority with twenty (20) Working Days' notice.  The expectation is that it will run for four years.
The expected total value of all Call-Off contracts for the DPS will be approximately £2 million for 2018-19.  Thereafter funding for DPS procurement will be annually agreed (amounts to be confirmed), and may include monies from other funding streams.

This DPS will be for the use of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), its Executive Agencies and those Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs) sponsored by DWP. Further information including a list of such Agencies and Public Bodies can be viewed by selecting 'Ministerial Departments' on the Departmental website.
